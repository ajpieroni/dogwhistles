# Glossary of Dogwhistles

Dogwhistles are coded expressions that simultaneously convey one meaning to a broad audience and a second one, often hateful or provocative, to a narrow in-group.\
                    \
                    This glossary contains 340 English-language dogwhistles and over 1,000 surface forms (morphological variants and closely-related terms), mostly from the U.S. context. Each dogwhistle is labeled with its signaled persona and covert meaning, along with its type and register. For more details, please refer to the [ACL 2023 paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a5731b32060909bfc8848fa5f7e1e14ca3b53240).

                            Talk of abolishing birthright citizenship (the Fourteenth Amendment in the United States), along with other rhetoric on illegal immigration, is used to appeal to racists who are mad about brown and black people being in 'Murica at all – though this is less dog whistle and more tuba, as the paper-thin pretense is almost discarded.

                            “Absentee fathers” only seem to come in one color: Black. Though there are fathers of all races and ethnicities who have a minimal presence in their childrens’ lives, “absentee” isn’t used to describe most of them. This racialized term uniquely targets Black fathers, inaccurately (and often purposely) signaling that they willfully abandon their children.

                            Adult human female" is a slogan and self-identification commonly used by TERFs. The phrase, based on the most succinct dictionary definitions of the word "woman," is an example of the argumentum ad dictionarium fallacy. The implication is that biological sex is inherent to womanhood because some dictionary definitions of "woman" include the word "female."

Some have drawn parallels between the "adult human female" meme and the "It's Okay to Be White" campaign started by white supremacists on 4chan in 2017. The goal of that campaign, as described by the Anti-Defamation League, was to "choose an ostensibly innocuous and inoffensive slogan, put that slogan on fliers bereft of any other words or imagery, then place the fliers in public locations" under the assumption that "liberals" would "react negatively to such fliers and condemn them or take them down, thus 'proving' that liberals did not even think it was 'okay' to be white." In a similar fashion, TERFs have weaponized the negative reaction that "adult human female" campaigns have received from those aware of their transphobic nature, using it to frame themselves as victims of cancel culture and oversensitive SJWs offended by the word "woman." TERFs were enraged when UK police investigated stickers with the "adult human female" slogan as hate speech in 2019. Such backlash is frequently cited by TERFs as "proof" of their conspiracy theory that gender-inclusive language is somehow a trans lobby plot to "erase women."

                            The Reagan administration also used--indeed, created-- affirmative action as a wedge issue. Affirmative action emerged in the late 1960s out of efforts to directly foster integration in schools and workplaces [and was broadly supported by the public into the 1980s]. Reagan set out to not only roll back but politicize affirmative action, and to spearhead this effort he appointed William Bradford Reynolds to head the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department...Under Reynolds, the Justice Department began highly public campaigns to oppose affirmative action, presenting numerous arguments to the Supreme Court that race-conscious remedies amounted to discrimination against innocent whites.

[Reagan's] broadsides against affirmative action constituted a form of dog whistle politics...In 1984, when Reagan won re-election in a landslide, the GOP platform had a new plank on affirmative action: ‘We will resist efforts to replace equal rights with discriminatory quota systems and preferential treatment. Quotas are the most insidious form of discrimination: reverse discrimination against the innocent.’ The document said nothing about race directly, but obviously ‘the innocent’ meant innocent whites. Attacking affirmative action provided a way for the GOP to constantly force race–and the party’s defense of white interests–  into the national conversation.

During the past year, the American people have been served up an unprecedented parade of environmental alarmism by the media and entertainment industry, which link every possible weather event to global warming. The year 2006 saw many major organs of the media dismiss any pretense of balance and objectivity on climate change coverage and instead crossed squarely into global warming advocacy.

                            When the Black Lives Matter motto arose, some people interpreted the phrase as confrontational and divisive. They took it to exclude other races. The phrase “all lives matter” sprang up in response, ostensibly to argue all lives are equal because we are all human beings. However, Black Lives Matter was not intended to mean that other lives do not matter. In a world where Black people are stigmatised, marginalised, and discriminated against, Black Lives Matter simply recognises Black lives matter, too. 

Responding to “Black Lives Matter” with “all lives matter” derails the specific conversation about racism against Black people. The phrase is seen to dismiss, ignore, or deny these problems — it shuts down this important discussion. US President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and other US conservatives like Rudy Guiliani, have used the phrase to criticise the Black Lives Matter movement. Through its use, “all lives matter” has also become associated with white supremacy, far-right nationalism and racism. So, “all lives matter” can be understood as a racist dog whistle — a direct push-back against the Black Lives Matter movement. It is far from an innocent term celebrating the worth of all humanity.

                            Enough already. Much of the contemporary conversation has adopted this new epitaph for the extreme right. But this is merely calling an old threat a new, slightly distracting name – and therefore possibly distorting or diluting the impact. Words matter. And so does clarity. As much as people are saying "call it by its name" about the controversial actions by extremists, we should keep this conversation clear and call these actors by their name. Avoid using "alt-right" and eliminate any confusion by calling them "white supremacists" or "racists" or "neo-Nazis" or "extreme right.

                            At the center of his foreign policy vision, Donald Trump has put “America First,” a phrase with an anti-Semitic and isolationist history going back to the years before the U.S. entry into World War II. Trump started using the slogan in the later months of his campaign, and despite requests from the Anti-Defamation League that he drop it, he stuck with it. Friday, he embraced the words as a unifying theme for his inaugural address. “From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land,” Trump said on the Capitol steps. “From this day forward, it’s going to be only America First. America First.”

Those same words galvanized a mass populist movement against U.S. entry into the war in Europe, even as the German army rolled through France and Belgium in the spring of 1940. While the America First Committee attracted a wide array of support, the movement was marred by anti-Semitic and pro-fascist rhetoric. Its highest profile spokesman, Charles Lindbergh, blamed American Jews for pushing the country into war. “The British and the Jewish races,” he said at a rally in September 1941, “for reasons which are not American, wish to involve us in the war.” The “greatest danger” Jews posed to the U.S. “lies in their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio, and our government,” Lindbergh said.

                            It’s shameful how the GOP field has perpetuated the ugly myth of a swarm of Mexican women crossing the border to have their children in this country and manipulate the immigration system — an absurd characterization that’s not supported by the facts. The reality is that American-born babies, who are U.S. citizens, cannot petition for their parents to gain legal immigration status until they are 21 years old. Not exactly the shortcut to citizenship Republicans claim it is.

The “anchor baby” narrative is politics at its worst — serving mostly as a Republican dog-whistle, tapping into an implicit racial sentiment that suggests children of color are less than fully American or they’re just a vehicle for gaming the system. It accomplishes nothing other than stoking the unwarranted fear that too many Americans continue to hold about our country’s changing demographics.

                            From a technical and thematic perspective it’s a well made ad. It’s also packed with anti-Semitic dog whistles, anti-Semitic tropes and anti-Semitic vocabulary. I’m not even sure whether it makes sense to call them dog whistles. The four readily identifiable American bad guys in the ad are Hillary Clinton, George Soros (Jewish financier), Janet Yellen (Jewish Fed Chair) and Lloyd Blankfein (Jewish Goldman Sachs CEO).

These are standard anti-Semitic themes and storylines, using established anti-Semitic vocabulary lined up with high profile Jews as the only Americans other than Clinton who are apparently relevant to the story. As you can see by my transcription, the Jews come up to punctuate specific key phrases. Soros: “those who control the levers of power in Washington”; Yellen “global special interests”; Blankfein “put money into the pockets of handful of large corporations.”

This is an anti-Semitic ad every bit as much as the infamous Jesse Helms ‘white hands’ ad or the Willie Horton ad were anti-African-American racist ads. Which is to say, really anti-Semitic. You could even argue that it’s more so, given certain linguistic similarities with anti-Semitic propaganda from the 1930s. But it’s not a contest. This is an ad intended to appeal to anti-Semites and spread anti-Semitic ideas. That’s the only standard that really matters. This is intentional and by design. It is no accident.

Trump has electrified anti-Semites and racist groups across the country. His own campaign has repeatedly found itself speaking to anti-Semites, tweeting their anti-Semitic memes, retweeting anti-Semites. His campaign manager, Steven Bannon, is an anti-Semite. The Breitbart News site he ran and will continue running after the campaign has become increasingly open in the last year with anti-Semitic attacks and politics.

It is less widespread than the idea of autogynephilia, and some advocates of the autogynephilia theory believe that there's no equivalent in trans men - because they are "women", and women don't have fetishes! But some TERFs insist it does exist, therefore trans men don't real. YouTuber Chase Ross has been cited by TERFs as an autoandrophile because his channel focuses on reviewing sex toys, packers, underwear, etc.

                            There is a long-arching stereotype about absent black fathers that Bryant seemed to be alluding to with the "baby daddy" comment. Yet, a Centers for Disease Control study of fathers' engagement found that African American fathers were more likely than white fathers to be engaged with their children's lives. Research shows that media spread myths about absent and disengaged black fathers.

Despite the theme of the conference, Bryant also missed an opportunity to delve into the impacts of incarceration on the nuclear family. Fwd.Us found that one in two people in the United States have had an immediate family member incarcerated, one in five had a parent incarcerated, and one in seven had a spouse or co-parent behind bars.

As some reporters have put it: many black men are quite literally missing because they are behind bars or suffer from low life expectancies. "For every 100 black women in this age group living outside of jail, there are only 83 black men. Among whites, the equivalent number is 99, nearly parity," data from the New York Times' Upshot show.

This became particularly pertinent post-Ferguson, where a police officer shot and killed teenager Michael Brown in broad daylight in 2014, launching years of protest and demands for police reform. In 2015, The New York Times found that of cities with at least 10,000 residents, Ferguson had the single largest proportion of missing black men. Economist Stephen Bronars found that in 2015, there were more than two young black women for each young black man in Ferguson.

Researcher Note: baby daddy is also a term used in African American English without the dogwhistled meaning.

                            What’s the difference between having a “blended family” and having “baby daddies” or “baby mamas”? Typically, it’s the race of the family members. These terms have a context-specific meaning within Black culture. But when used by people who are not Black, and especially when used by white people or anyone in an official capacity (such as a newscaster) the meaning changes. These terms, which may masquerade as playful and harmless, have the effect of undermining the seriousness of a relationship or implying lack of personal responsibility, and are especially aimed at women.

                            When these white Americans say “Back the Blue,” the implicit statement is actually “Enforce White Supremacy.” We see in the violence at the Capitol just how much these people believe in “backing the blue” when the police (even mildly) attempt to enforce the law against them. One police officer was beaten unconscious and then dragged down the steps by the mob as they used the poles of their American flags to beat him further. Another officer was beaten with a fire extinguisher and died later that night. That officer was himself a Trump supporter, yet that could not save him from the violence of white supremacy that demanded his fealty.

Specifically, the question of whether certain traditionally anti-Semitic tropes were used deliberately or innocently was at the crux of a famous historiographical debate in the 1960s about the Populist movement. Were the Populists’ attacks on greedy bankers—some of which used terms like Shylock or invoked the Rothschilds—meant to focus anger and hatred on the Jews, or was the association so sublimated that the Populists didn’t even realize they were blowing a dogwhistle?

                            Antisemitism may indeed work while never uttering the word "Jew". Some simply replace "Jews" for "Zionists", while others use the evil bankster trope without ever saying or implying that the "banksters" are Jews. (Hint: If your opponent starts quoting the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, they might just be a tad antisemitic.)....While not everybody who speaks of "banksters" and "loan sharks" may necessarily mean Jewish "banksters" and "loan sharks", the undertone is quite notable in many of those screeds. Some leftists have always criticized this wrongheaded criticism of capitalism, including Karl Marx who has written about this phenomenon.

The alt-right generally describes anyone who promotes racism as "based". The term gained mainstream usage through Gamergate's descriptions of pro-Gamergate YouTubers as "based", although it was originally used by American rapper Lil B the "BasedGod" in a different context; he defined the term that denotes a lifestyle of positivity and tolerance, the complete opposite to the alt-right's appropriation of the phrase. Alt-righters often pair the term with the adjective cucked: something or someone that doesn't accept alt-right views.

SuperStraight was a failed prank that originated on TikTok and quickly spread to Twitter and 4chan in March 2021 to try to drive a wedge between transgender people and other members of the LGBTQ community. The phrase and hashtag was accompanied by a black-and-orange "Pride" flag (incidentally, the same colors used both by Pornhub and—ironically—by gay dating app Grindr). It essentially was for straight people who wouldn't date trans people, as if dating a trans person means you are less straight.

                            \
                            The single most common response to concerns about racial disparities in police use of force and the criminal justice system is, "But what about black-on-black crime?"

The question raises the disproportionate levels of crime in black communities — particularly the thousands of homicides each year in which the offender and victim are black — to, on its face, argue that people should worry about black-on-black crime before they worry about police brutality. (Although this ignores the work that many black leaders have done in this area on top of their work on criminal justice issues.)

But it's also playing on a racist idea: that black people are all criminals, so they deserve to be treated differently. The idea is that since crime is higher in black communities, police are justified in going into these places and essentially doing as they wish.

It's true that crime is higher in black communities. But simplifying the connection between racial disparities in the justice system and crime misses other factors, like implicit bias. A review of the research by the Sentencing Project concluded that throughout various periods in the past few decades, the higher crime rates in black communities only explained about 61 to 80 percent of black overrepresentation in prisons.

Nonetheless, concern trolling about black-on-black crime is a very successful way to divert the conversation by playing into racist stereotypes that paint black people as criminals. It shows another way coded language can work: It can be used to signal that white people shouldn't really care about an issue affecting a certain group, because, the thinking goes, that group brought it upon itself.

                            Wherever one goes, one sees altered flags, signs and bumper-stickers saying “blue lives matter.” Aside from the smart few who display them on cars because a cop would be more inclined to let you off with a warning, these mostly white, conservative people are oblivious of the racist reek of these signs.

Who doesn’t think cops’ lives matter? Only criminals and some on the far, far left. Black Lives Matter is about the disproportional violence African Americans meet at the hands of the police. “Blue lives matter” implies that Black people do not care about cops. There is not a systemic or racial attack on cops, only the dangers and tragedies that have always crossed the thin blue line that should protect all of us.

                            Boogaloo, boogalo, boog, and big igloo are code words for a rebellion against perceived tyranny, but often used as a cover for (Or misinterpreted as) a race war and the second American Civil War. The term boogaloo is derived from the 1984 movie Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo which is a commonly used phrase online to indicate any sort of sequel, particularly a poor quality one. Big igloo is a derivative synonym that refers to boogaloo  and probably to the "big tent" idea of inclusiveness (but for white people since igloos are white), but more likely as a way of evading attempts at moderation. In search of further homophone-ish phrases for their shitposting, this term further morphed into the phrase big luau online, as a reference to the unusually high number of "Boogaloo Boys" posting images wearing Hawaiian shirts. This led to a bizarre situation during lockdown protests regarding the 2019-20 COVID-19 outbreak, where many of the far-right extremists that attended showed their devotion to white supremacy by (in reference to the luau) dressing in Hawaiian shirts.

                            Bop was popularized as a cutesy term on the Fren World subreddit, meaning to hit, but quickly became used in the barely-covert alt-right Fren memes as a euphemism for 'attack' or 'kill', particularly in the phrase bop the non-frens. When Fren subs began to be banned by Reddit, "bopped" also became a common term to describe a post, user, or subreddit being banned.

                            Sarcastic phrase implying trans women are, or expect to be, showered with undue praise just for existing. Often used when a TERF is referring to reports of a trans woman allegedly committing violent or sexual offences e.g. "the BRAVE and STUNNING defendant pleaded guilty to three counts of public indecency." It is also used by the far-right. (It was popularized by a South Park episode where the media repeatedly used the phrase to describe Caitlyn Jenner even as she behaved crudely and ran over people with her car.)

                            In the context of describing families facing challenges, the “broken family” term aims to ascribe blame to family structure, rather than the social structures, institutions and policies that have failed those families. This term is most frequently assigned to Black families and is part of the larger set of narratives that hold white and non-white people to different standards. It wrongly signals that the challenges Black people face are of their own making, the result of dysfunctional or irresponsible choices. As this logic goes, families are broken because the people in them are broken: it’s not that social injustice has broken them, it’s that they are inherently inferior as people, as evidenced by their class and race. It’s always about them, not the system. Using this term, especially in the context of Black families, infuses any conversation with this entire line of thinking and judgment—whether explicitly or unconsciously. It also presents Black families as hopeless: perpetually broken and unable to be set right,people who get what they deserve given the “choices” they have made...

Public opinion rooted in conservatism and religious values has never accepted families that deviate from the traditional two-married-parent nuclear family home, and punishes families that do not fit into this model. But in the context of talking about Black families, the term runs deeper: the idea that Black people are incapable of creating successful family structures and that Black children raised by single mothers are delinquent.

The term “broken home” not only lacks empathy and accuracy, it lacks specificity. While highly racialized, it is used to describe everything from divorce and single-parent homes to abuse or poverty, rendering it practically meaningless.

It is similar in meaning to the incelese term bluepill. They have no individuality, are sometimes said to be "soulless" and have a thousand-yard "insectoid" stare that gives away that they are "dead inside". Their lives are empty and without meaning or purpose except to be consumers and serve corporations. It is a clear attempt at dehumanization and is similar to the NPC meme.

                            Burning coal and coal burner are derisive terms for a white woman having sex with a black man. Largely used as a reference to the full phrase "burn the coal, pay the toll", implying that a white woman who has sex with a black man will meet with violence, end up pregnant and abandoned, or otherwise have some terrible comeuppance for her crimes against the white race. It also applies to white men who have sex with black women, where the white man will pay for his alleged crimes against the white race. Coal digger and mud shark are similarly-employed pejoratives. Contrast with bed wench, used in some black supremacist circles to describe black women having sex with white men.

                            A small, powerful group that seeks to establish control. 

Jews have long been accused of being part of a secret group that controls the economic and political world order. The term cabal originates from the word kabbalah, the Jewish mystical interpretation of the Hebrew Bible. Often denoted as “Jewish cabal” on social media, it is a dog whistle for Jewish control.

Several antisemitic publications and conspiracy theories capitalize on this imagery of a conniving cohort, such as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion or the New World Order theory which is based on the idea that Jews have formed a power structure in which they control the media, economy, and politics.

He has long been idolized by Swedish far-right groups, being seen as the last king during an era when Sweden was considered a great power. November 30th, the day of his death, was used by Swedish neo-Nazis and other extremists as a day for their rallies. Due to the influence of the Internet, this status spread to other parts of the far right. Notably, when one of Tucker Carlson's writers was caught on an online neo-Nazi forum, he was using the pseudonym "CharlesXII".

The term originated from the YouTube series "You Can't Stump the Trump" mid 2015, where the track "Centipede" by Knife Party plays as the introduction. The introduction to the track contains audio from a BBC nature documentary in which a centipede is described as a "predator" and "nimble navigator", likening it to Trump himself in the context of the video.

It was quickly picked up as a meme by Trump supporters (especially /r/the_donald) and centipede became synonymous with Trump and his supporters, to the chagrin of entomologists everywhere.

                            What this means is they don’t know anything about medical transition pathways and are using misinformation to demonise the trans community. Medical transition is not available to children. Another word they may use in this context is, “transing.” You can’t make someone trans, just as you can’t make someone gay.

                            While efforts to wrangle the COVID-19 outbreak continue worldwide, the World Health Organization is contending with another type of viral spread in the form of conservative American politicians stigmatizing Chinese people for political gain. Despite the fact that pandemics can start anywhere and — by definition — spread beyond geopolitical boundaries, these politicians have stood by their use of terms like “Wuhan virus” and “foreign virus,” ignoring examples of Asians being verbally and physically assaulted due to being linked with the new coronavirus.

Despite WHO’s efforts, leading U.S. conservative politicians and influencers have continued embracing such terminology as “dog whistles” — coded language that can be used to denigrate a group while publicly denying you are doing it — that implicitly blame Chinese people for the viral outbreak. While such language has circulated online since the early days of the outbreak, it was not until well after WHO’s efforts to push back against stigmatizing terms that needlessly divisive COVID-19 rhetoric erupted more broadly within online conservative political discourse. Some conservatives have even embraced using these terms as a badge of honor, such as Jack Posobiec temporarily changing his Twitter name to “Wuhan Jack.”

The widespread online debate about COVID-19 and dog-whistle rhetoric was sparked on March 8 following a tweet from U.S. Representative Paul Gosar, in which the Republican lawmaker from Arizona referred to COVID-19 as “Wuhan virus.” According to Trendinalia, a tool used to monitor trending topics on Twitter, the phrase “Wuhan virus” began trending that same day and into the next. Predominantly Democratic politicians and progressive influencers on Twitter repudiated Rep. Gosar’s word choice and decried the politician for the implications of the terminology. But even well-intentioned tweets highlighting Rep. Gosar’s phrasing became a form of amplification in itself, feeding the term more oxygen by distributing it to a broader public.

The proliferation of these dog-whistle terms shows no signs of abating, as certain conservative politicians and influencers dig in their heels about their usage, all despite WHO’s warning that such language is contributing to an infodemic in which the public is struggling to vet the reliability of COVID-19 information, while further stigmatizing Chinese people and other populations in the process.

                            Charges of “rootless cosmopolitanism”, “citizen of nowhere”, and “international elite”, are anti-semitic tropes, which have been used throughout the 20th century to cast aspersions on Jews. Now those same old tropes are being used to call the loyalty into question, not only of immigrants in the UK and British expats, but also of well-educated British people who feel cosmopolitan, or who dare to have an ethnically diverse workforce….

Hitler and others used charges of cosmopolitanism against Jews, pitting them against the native-born population, described by Hitler in his 1933 campaign speech to Siemens factory workers as “people [who] are bounded to their soil, bounded to its fatherland, bounded to the possibilities of life that the state … offers”. By contrast, Hitler described Jews as “…a small, rootless, international clique that is turning the people against each other, that does not want them to have peace. It is the people who are at home both nowhere and everywhere, who do not have anywhere a soil on which they have grown up, but who live in Berlin today, in Brussels tomorrow, Paris the day after that, and then again in Prague or Vienna or London, and who feel at home everywhere.”

                            The U.S. unequivocally uses the prison system for profit rather than reform. America has the highest rate of incarceration in the world—disproportional to our population—and currently allows that system to function as a modern means of systemic oppression. Law and order rhetoric—which emphasizes ‘cleaning up the streets’, protecting youth from succumbing to drug use, and reducing violence— almost always has racist undertones that persecute the existence of Black individuals, particularly low income Black individuals. This, in conjunction with tough on crime mentalities, have allowed racist and ineffective policies to become the norm.

                            Clownfish are sequential hermaphrodites. This means that male-to-female sex changes are a natural part of their reproductive biology. Clownfish schools are led by a female. When this female dies, the dominant male changes sex and takes her place, becoming a fertile (i.e. egg-producing) female. TERF references to clownfish are intended to mock and otherize trans women, suggesting that the idea humans can change sex is absurd because humans are not fish. This also meshes with the Clown World dogwhistle.

Until the story broke, this subculture could go around calling people and events "coincidences" with impunity – pointing to an anti-Trump article by a Jewish author, for example — maybe confusing readers who didn’t share their views, but not raising any hackles.

                            Conservative advocates of colorblindness use this term as a shorthand for their opposition to affirmative action. They contend that colorblindness means government should never take race into account, not even as a way to promote racial equality....by 1965, a conservative form of colorblindness had emerged: according to the newest friends of the theory, the Constitution forbade any state use of race, whether to segregate or--and this was the real agenda--to integrate.

Colorblindness lies at the heart of the contemporary belief held by many whites that they are the true racial victims in US society today…It sounds liberal yet works like a racial cudgel, denying that there’s discrimination against minorities, elevating whites as racial victims, justifying white superiority, and facilitating dog whistle racial appeals that emphasize culture and comportment. 

And one more thing: colorblindness also protects dog whistle race-baiting against charges of racism. Even though conservatives repeatedly use an ethnic vocabulary, they always hold in reserve the colorblind insistence that race is just a matter of blood. This provides a stock defense of dog whistling, for it allows politicians to demagogue culture and behavior, while insisting that they cannot possibly be engaged in racial pandering because they have not directly referenced biology

                            “Cosmopolitan” and “elite” are terms that have separately incited antisemites across the political spectrum. Based on stereotypes of Jewish wealth and insularity, Jews have been accused of being part of an elite class for centuries. In the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, for instance, Jews were charged with being “rootless cosmopolitans” and fell victim to Stalin’s anti-cosmopolitan campaign where they were arrested and tortured. Today, “cosmopolitan elite” is a code word used by the far-right to accuse Jews and liberals of controlling America and/or being disloyal and unpatriotic by favoring internationalism over isolationism.

                            \
                            Moral panic over CRT has been fuelled for more than a year by Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News and other rightwing media, an apparent backlash to racial justice protests that followed the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis last year. In such hands, CRT became a catch-all for any teaching about race and American history.

“It is a very convenient soundbite for encapsulating everything about the reckoning after George Floyd’s death and the Black Lives Matter movement,” said Tanya Hernández, a law professor at Fordham University in New York. “Those who are making a lot of noise about critical race theory have no interest in learning what it’s really about because it’s not their focal point, just a nice encapsulation as a reference point of everything they don’t like. They don’t want any discussion about the accuracy and the truthfulness of our racial histories to be taught to children.”

It proved the right dog-whistle in the right place at the right time. Youngkin tapped into a surge of frustration among suburban parents after months of school closures due to the coronavirus pandemic. This included grumbles about teachers’ unions, mask mandates and what they witnessed about their children’s education during months of remote learning.

Tara Setmayer, a senior adviser to the Lincoln Project, a group opposed to Donald Trump and Trumpism, said: “Republicans are the masters at finding an issue playing on the racial resentment and grievance within the Republican party base and creating this perception that somehow this is a threat to children, to white America, and some type of invasion of the education system. “Critical race theory doesn’t even exist here and most people don’t know what it is. But it is a masterclass in how perception is reality and, when propaganda isn’t pushed back on, it can metastasise in ways that become problematic in campaigns. That’s exactly what happened in Virginia.”

Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: “Lee Atwater, who was considered one of the greatest Republican political operatives, understood that racial resentment animates a lot of white suburban voters and you can manipulate that to get people to the polls. Critical race theory now is the modern day version of the southern strategy.”

How real this connection is to some became apparent in March 2019 when the gunman who killed 50 people at two mosques in New Zealand, was found to have the names of Christian Serbian military leaders, who battled the Ottoman Muslims centuries ago, written on his ammunition (Arsenault, 2019)

The term is used as a mocking euphemism for terrorist attacks, street crimes, or other problems the alt-right believes to stem from large minority or immigrant populations. The term is also switched around with a similar term, culturally enriched, with the same predictable results and statements from alt-righters.

                            \
                            A number of the conspiracy theorists tracing the origins of “cultural Marxism” assign outsize significance to the Frankfurt School, an interwar German — and mostly Jewish — intellectual collective of left-wing social theorists and philosophers. Many members of the Frankfurt School fled Nazism and came to the United States, which is where they supposedly uploaded the virus of cultural Marxism to America. These zany stories of the Frankfurt School’s role in fomenting political correctness would be entertaining, except that they echo the baseless allegations of tiny cabals ruling the world that fed the right’s paranoid imagination in prior eras.

The wider discourse around cultural Marxism today resembles nothing so much as a version of the Judeobolshevik myth updated for a new age. In the years after the Russian Revolution, fantasists took advantage of the fact that many of its instigators were Jewish to suggest that people could save time by equating Judaism and communism — and kill off both with one blow. As the historian Paul Hanebrink recounts in an unnerving new study, according to the Judeobolshevik myth, the instigators of communism were the Jews as a whole, not some tiny band of thinkers, conniving as a people to bring communist irreligion and revolution worldwide.

The results of such beliefs weren’t pretty. According to Professor Hanebrink, many aspects of the Judeobolshevik fantasy survived the Holocaust it helped bring about, just with the role of the Jews implied more euphemistically or replaced by new adversaries. As in Judeobolshevism, cultural Marxism homogenizes vast groups of shadowy enemies and assigns them a secret design to upend society. As in Judeobolshevism, those supposedly under threat are invited to identify themselves with “the Christian West” and surge in self-defense before it is too late.

                            The culture enricher expression, which is known to still circulate in its sarcastic form in far-right settings in Sweden, has a background in Neo-Nazism. In the 1980s and 90s, it became widespread in these settings as: a coded expression for everything they dislike about the immigration and refugee politics and as a joke on the anti-racists, who have often cited culture enrichment, exotic food, and folk dance as arguments for increased immigration. Neo-Nazi papers from this time show use of culture enricher as a synonym to immigrant, and as a commetary of the issues that immigrant related crime, violence, attitudes, and culture bring to Swedish society.

                            Dog-whistle politics is partly about demonizing people of color, but it's also about demonizing government in a way that helps the very rich, says López. So, when Ronald Regan said "cut taxes," what he was communicating to the middle class was, "so your taxes won't be wasted on minorities." A key Reagan operative admitted as much in an interview quoted in Lopez's book, saying, " 'We want to cut taxes' … is a whole lot more abstract than, 'Nigger, nigger.' " It continues to be more abstract, and it continues to work.

                            Suggesting Israel is responsible for American police brutality due to training programs between U.S. and Israeli police forces. The deadly exchange trope directly compares U.S. police actions against Black Americans with the Israeli Defense Forces’ (IDF) treatment of Palestinians. Believers in the “deadly exchange” allege “worst practices” are shared [between U.S. and Israeli armed forces] to promote and extend discriminatory and repressive policing practices that already exist in both countries, including racial profiling, massive spying and surveillance, deportation and detention, and attacks on human rights defenders.” Users of this trope argue Israeli and U.S. law enforcement exchange security practices and ideologies to purposely target people of color. This false equivalence appeared in demonstrations in the summer of 2020 when protesters chanted “Israel, we know you, you murder children, too" (see blood libel). This is categorically false. Accusing Israel or Zionists (see Zionists) of complicity in the murder of Black people is malicious, perpetuates antisemitism, and blames Jews for societal ills

They co-opted the emojis to proudly proclaim their bigotry after Labour MP David Lammy denounced transphobes as "dinosaurs" who want to "hoard rights" at a September 2021 party event. This was a poorly-worded version of a common counterargument to the reactionary myth that granting increased rights to marginalized groups will mean less rights for non-marginalized groups. (Compare to MRA claims that feminism will somehow make second-class citizens of cis men). TERFs responded by misrepresenting Lammy's statement as a misogynist telling uppity women defending their "sex-based rights" to wheesht.

                            George W. Bush mentioned the Dred Scott decision in a presidential debate. His language simply referenced the disastrous 1857 decision for some viewers, but it had a different meaning for others. Bush's curious Dred Scott reference in the context of a question about judicial nominations was arguably a way to signal to Christian conservatives that he would nominate a justice who disagreed with Roe v. Wade (Kirkpatrick 2004). The two cases have been linked in the Christian, pro-life community based on their association between slavery and abortion. They argue that abortion and slavery are both instances where the strong, or politically powerful, have a responsibility to protect the week, and that an overly activist Supreme Court erred in both Dred Scott and Roe v. Wade by not recognizing the humanity in slaves and the unborn (Buckley 2000). The appeal was targeted based on its limited cultural resonance; the appeal only signaled abortion to a narrow subset of the population. Given the controversial nature of an anti-Roe v. Wade signal, the specificity of the cue was strategic.

                            The term dual citizen (and its variants) are used to claim that anyone who is Jewish is automatically an Israeli citizen, and by extension of suspect loyalty to their home country. Very popularly used in declarations like "X members of the US Congress are dual citizens." In reality, Jewish persons with no other ties to Israel are eligible to apply for and gain Israeli citizenship under the 1950 Law of Return, but are not automatically citizens. And of course accusing Jewish people of divided loyalties to the country where they live goes back for centuries.

                            Dual loyalty is a bigoted trope used to cast Jews as the “other.” For example, it becomes antisemitic when an American Jew’s connection to Israel is scrutinized to the point of questioning his or her trustworthiness or loyalty to the United States (see Figure D4). Dual loyalty accusations also occur on U.S. college campuses when Jewish students are asked to denounce the actions of the Israeli government in order to participate in progressive activities. By accusing Jews of being disloyal citizens whose true allegiance is to Israel or a hidden Jewish agenda (see globalist), antisemites sow distrust and spread harmful ideas—like the belief that Jews are a traitorous “fifth column,” meaning they are undermining their country from within. The allegation of dual loyalty can also be aimed at non-Jews for what antisemites see as being “excessively loyal to Israel,” a criticism rarely leveled against friends and supporters of other countries (see Figure D5). For centuries, these antisemitic accusations of disloyalty have led to the harassment, marginalization, oppression, and murder of Jewish people. (AJC Translate Hate glossary)

                            After all, people who are losing ground economically are going to be angry, depressed and generally upset and Trump speaks to those feelings very directly. (The name of his latest book is "Crippled America.") President Obama talked about this at some length yesterday, saying that Trump was "exploiting" these peoples' fears. And they do have a right to be afraid. As anyone who's been following the political discussion about income inequality over the past few years knows, they are losing ground. The latest research shows that the incomes of the top 20% grew on average 42.6% since 1979, the middle only grew 9.5% and the bottom 20% actually fell by 2.7%. Many of these non-college educated white working class Trump fans are either in what we would call the lower middle class or among the lower 20%. If they are anxious you cannot blame them.

On the other hand, there is an assumption that somehow Trump's message is speaking to this particular complaint and that is questionable. Trump, after all, is the guy who said in a debate in answer to a question about whether he supported a raise in the minimum wage that he not only didn't support the raise but that he thinks wages are already too high! He went on "Morning Joe" the next morning and made his case even more strenuously. It makes little sense that such a message would resonate with these white working class people who are flocking to his rallies. No, whatever is drawing them Trump it certainly isn't the fact that these people are disaffected economically and Trump is offering them the road to riches.

What if it isn't that these angry working class whites are attracted to Trump because he's giving voice to their economic problems at all, whether by offering some vague notion of "making America great again" or telling them their problems are caused by undocumented workers? What if their "anxiety" is really just about simple racism --- the fact that people they believe are inferior to them are becoming equal in society?

That these white folks might sincerely be more upset about African Americans becoming equal or undocumented immigrants destroying "American culture" or Muslims worshipping a religion they find threatening and weird than their own economic well-being is an unsettling thought. But it's very hard to ignore the fact that in good times and bad it still exists. As Bouie wrote: These voters may feel anxious about their economic status. But they also hold racial and cultural resentments. They’re worried about their futures and they dislike immigrants, Muslims, and blacks.

And Trump is pushing the racial and cultural resentment button a lot harder than he's pushing the economic button. In fact, he's pushing the resentment button so hard that it's activated some very serious racists who truly had been pushed to the fringes of the right wing fever swamps. According to a rather disturbing story this week in the Washington Post there has been a surge of excitement among white supremacists. It quotes a number of different leaders of the movement who are thrilled at the prospect of one of their "own" getting mainstream credibility. Trump is often said by his followers to be "saying what they're thinking." These racists feel exactly the same way.

                            “Election integrity” is a long-standing dog whistle phrase for targeting voters of color with accusations of voter fraud. This is part of a political strategy shared by politicians, political parties, and “extended party networks,” or groups of party-affiliated activists that push political parties to change behavior. In the post-Reconstruction South, white Democrats used the “election integrity” strategy to motivate the white public to disallow Black men from voting. Today, Republicans and Republican-backed activist networks are using “election integrity” claims to target Democratic voters, with particular emphasis on discrediting Black and Hispanic voters, in an attempt to de-legitimize any election Democrats carry. The purpose of “election integrity” claims are to create political justifications in the name of democratic security to limit access to the vote of political opponents. This is anti-democratic behavior.

[Romney's speech] was a testament to the triumph of dogwhistle politics. How so, if Romney disparaged half the country and never mentioned race? On one level, the answer lies in the language of dependency, entitlement, and lack of responsibility. It's clear from his larger campaign that Romney understood the power of such coded language. He seemed to learn from the primary contest, where Newt Gingrish made hay by lambasting Obama as the food stamp president. Seeking to make welfare a major issue in the race, during the 2012 summer Romney produced several TV ads slamming Obama for allegedly ending the requirement that welfare recipients actively seek employment...It was for this relatively crude racial demagoguery that many commentators criticized Romney. His welfare ads were sharply attacked as dogwhistle politics...

But there was another level of dog whistle politics evident in Romney's campaign, a deeper connection far more consequential to the middle class yet completely unseen by most critics. Romney's true debt to dog whistle politics lay in his ability to garner widespread support while espousing plutocratic priorities...he would pare government entitlement programs that transferred resources to the least productive elements in society.

                            With help from the Heritage Foundation, Bush pushed through one of the biggest tax cuts with the bold prediction that they would lead to economic growth sufficient to pay off the national debt by 2010. In 2007, with the budget deficit ballooning to historic highs, Heritage reversed course and looked to dog whistle appeals to cover up how wrong they and the Bush administration had been. Now, they claimed that it was "entitlement spending" that was dwarfing the "projected large revenue increases" that the tax cuts had supposedly generated. According to the rightwing narrative coming out of Heritage, the deficit was not the result of a massive transfer of wealth to the rich but of government social aid programs. Hesitancy regarding dog whistle politics may have increased, but oligarchy-friendly policies continued to need the cover provided by racial narratives about out of control liberal programs.

                            A conspiracy theory invented by TERFs that is essentially their version of the "great replacement" myth. The idea, as expressed by Saint Rowling, is that the trans-rights movement is "seeking to erode 'woman' as a political and biological class." What this means is that TERFs really don't like gender-inclusive language because it acknowledges the existence of trans and gender-diverse people. They insist that recognising trans women as women will render the word "woman" meaningless, allowing "men" (trans women) to force their way into women's sports, women's shelters, women's spots on public boards, and women's award nominations. This will somehow enable (cis) women to be subjugated as they have since time immemorial, except now the oppression is of an exceedingly vague, unverifiable nature.

TERFs also object to language intended to be inclusive of trans men (on the rare occasion they acknowledge their existence). Phrases like "people who menstruate" and "pregnant people" acknowledge that trans men and AFAB enbies also experience menstruation and pregnancy, and that neither of those things are universal experiences even among cis women. Many cis women of child-bearing age don't have periods regularly or at all due to health conditions like polycystic ovary syndromeWikipedia and pretty much every cis women over the age of 50 no longer menstruates due to menopause. Defining womanhood by reproductive biology isn't helpful or all that feminist. As TERFs have it, however, inclusive language is a Very Bad Thing and an evil trans lobby plot. Fair Play for Women released a press statement ominously warning that the "very words we use to describe ourselves as a sex class are being erased." According to the group, phrases like "menstruator," "uterus-haver," and "people with a vagina" are a "dehumanising" affront to (cis) women, not a concise and practical way for media reports and health campaign literature to include trans and non-binary people. The alternative would be clunky wording like "cis women, trans men, and non-binary people with uteruses." Many of the phrases TERFs object to most vehemently aren't even used that much. No one refers to cis women as "cervix-owners" outside of narrow contexts like trying to educate people about the necessity of regular cervical cancer screenings. TERFs nonetheless screech that cis women are "losing the words we need to talk about our bodies, our needs and our rights." Nevermind what words trans people (who aren't really people after all /s) and many cis people might prefer to use to discuss their bodies, their needs, and their rights.

Some of the more batshit, conspiracy-minded TERFs have even speculated that uterus transplants, artificial wombs, and other emerging reproductive technologies might allow "men" (a category which, in their bigoted minds, includes trans women) to somehow "erase women from existence completely."

                            “Family values” politics, as the historian Seth Dowland has explained in his recent history of the movement, arose in the 1970s out of religious conservatives’ fears about how the social and political changes of the previous decade were altering traditional gender roles, loosening sexual norms, and weakening moral opposition to evils like homosexuality and pornography. The first time the GOP used this phrase was in its national platform in 1976, expressing its “concern for family values.” The statement went on to say, “it is imperative that our government’s programs, actions, officials and social welfare institutions never be allowed to jeopardize the family. We fear the government may be powerful enough to destroy our families; we know that it is not powerful enough to replace them.”

Arguing that the family—by which they meant the two-parent heterosexual unit with a male breadwinner and female homemaker—was under attack from Washington and Hollywood, religious conservatives partnered with the Republican Party to fuel a whole set of reactionary politics through the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s that targeted feminism and the Equal Rights Amendment, public schooling and sex education, and abortion rights and gay rights, all through the language of “family values.”

Thus it is imperative that our government's programs, actions, officials and social welfare institutions never be allowed to jeopardize the family. We fear the government may be powerful enough to destroy our families; we know that it is not powerful enough to replace them."\

                            \
                            Another approach by antisemites is to deploy conspiracy theories that name agents like like “international bankers” or organizations like the Federal Reserve. In the original form, for example, the Federal Reserve was accused of being formed by Jewish bankers. “International bankers” became a commonly used code word referring to Jews, as well.

However, when someone invokes these conspiracy theories today, they may or may not be aware of these histories. Here, the background of the speaker is of importance; we should treat the use of these differently if a known antisemite like Duke invokes them, rather than if they are espoused by an otherwise unproblematic left-wing critic of globalization.

However, the intention of the speaker does not necessarily have anything to do with the impact of the narrative. In both cases, the speaker is using the emotional power of the antisemitic narrative: an apocalyptic battle between a secretive evil elite and a virtuous people. And, intentionally or not, these narratives are also received by some listeners as code words: antisemites will understand that the Federal Reserve and the international bankers refer to the Jewish conspiracy.

While it can be argued whether conspiracy theories about the Federal Reserve, international bankers, or the New World Order constitute antisemitism when used by otherwise unproblematic actors, they are both politically fallacious world views, and anyone who takes antisemitism seriously would avoid the use of these terms and narratives because of their histories.

In Bannon’s case, he has read the classics of reactionary nationalist literature, and understands very well that some of his listeners will interpret the constant invocations of classic antisemitic images and narratives to mean “the Jews.” Just as with his approach to ethno-nationalists, it appears that Bannon wants a “washed out” antisemitism, based directly on the antisemitic narrative structure and using its imagery (octopuses, puppet masters, cliques of international banker) while either naming individual Jews, or groups that others had previously been identified as Jewish (as the Frankfurt School, the Federal Reserve), as the villains. He is no doubt intentionally using these narratives to appeal to both antisemites and those who don’t understand the double meaning— while simultaneously inoculating against accusations of antisemitism.

                            One relatively new, particularly anti-Semitic, meme known as “fellow white people” requires some unpacking. It’s not new but has recently bubbled up to the surface again in recent weeks — and it promulgates the belief that Jews are merely “masquerading” as whites as a way to tear down the white nation from the inside.

The meme is sometimes accompanied with a modified version of the “happy merchant” meme — picturing the hook-nosed anti-Semitic caricature wearing a “white” mask.

The meme is meant to highlight what the “alt-right” sees as the “shapeshifting” and ultimately non-white nature of Jews. Jews, the thinking goes, call themselves white when they want to appeal to “fellow whites” — and call for things like immigration reform or civil rights — but also call themselves members of a minority class when it suits them.

The broader debate around Jews and whiteness is fraught and breaks out within the Jewish community every few months. What this meme suggests is that, regardless of what any Jew may feel, the “alt-right” sees them as non-whites.

In this context, it wasn't heavily stigmatized. Fast-forward to the 1960s, when Lyndon Johnson made it clear that he wanted it to have a racial-justice component. "Then it becomes possible for conservatives to start painting welfare as a transfer of wealth to minorities," says Lopez. Remember those Reagan speeches about welfare queens? Today, says López, we hear "food stamps" used similarly.

It is also wrong to forbid children to attend schools restricted to members of another race. I condemn that sort of segregation because it is compulsory.

There is another way that people may separate and distinguish themselves from each other. Far from being compulsory, it is the necessary result of freedom-the freedom of association. 

Throughout this land of ours, we find people forming churches, clubs, and neighborhoods with other families of similar beliefs, similar tastes, and similar ethnic backgrounds. No one would think of insisting that neighborhoods be "integrated" with fixed proportions of Anglo-Americans, German-Americans, Swedish-Americans-or of Catholics, Protestants, and Jews.

 To me, it is wrong to take some children out of the schools they would normally attend and bus them to others-just to get a mixture of ethnic and racial groups that somebody thinks is desirable. This forced integration is just as wrong as forced segregation."\

                            A meme where members of the alt-right "joke" about giving leftists "free helicopter rides" (read: executing their political opponents). This is in reference to the extrajudicial executions (death flights) during the Dirty War in Argentina and following the 1973 Chilean coup. Political opponents of Argentina's Admiral Luis María Mendía and Chile's Augusto Pinochet were flown over the ocean in an airplane or helicopter and pushed to their death. This meme seemed to gain popularity early in Donald Trump's campaign, when he gave helicopter rides to children at the Iowa State Fair. To Trump's credit, he did not murder them.

                            Fren is a corruption of the word "friend". It is a dog whistle used by a subsection of the alt-right, commonly found on the r/FrenWorld subreddit on Reddit. The idea is to talk like a small child or intellectually disabled person whilst still talking about general alt-right bigotry, the pattern of which emerged with the aforementioned Apu Apustaja meme.

Closely connected to the honkler/Clown World memes; the Honkler and other Pepes can be seen in many of their memes. After the CringeAnarchy subreddit was shut down when the moderators refused to delete posts calling for genocide, many users migrated to the r/FrenWorld,which was itself shut down in June 2019. This word is also used by fans of the band Twenty One Pilots, so check context.

Only sex that is assigned at birth should matter, therefore, it's fine to discriminate and stereotype based on the latter. Note that the expression is however sometimes used by well-meaning individuals as well. The term originally referred to a type of feminism that opposes "gender" in the sense of gender roles and having gender determine everything about an individual's selfhood, and believe a society moving beyond that would be better for everyone including trans people (some of whom support the actual philosophy). Ironically, TERFs tend to believe in gender essentialism, and strictly tying someone's identity to their birth sex, no matter what they claim on paper.

- feminize men
- erase the meaning of "woman" by letting trans women use the term "woman"
- turn cis lesbians into straight women and then replace lesbians with "fake" trans lesbians
- destroy lesbianism by pushing young AFAB individuals into calling themselves "non-binary", "trans men", "queer", "pansexual" instead of the classical "lesbian"

                            The idea that everyone is raised in the gender role relating to their assigned sex at birth, and it is impossible to overcome this socialization as an adult. In other words trans women are socialized as males and will always act like men, and trans men are socialized as females and will always act like women. This apparently includes people who socially transition in early childhood. "Gender socialization" is a very popular concept among Russian TERFs, who talk about female gender socialization and male gender socialization.

Because apparently, promoting anti-scientific attitudes and conspiracy theories is only bad if trans people and their allies are (allegedly) doing it.

                            The current portraiture of Soros, now ascendant if not dominant online, isn’t interested in that sort of complexity. For the far right, from Russia to central Europe and increasingly, America, Soros is the latest Jewish manipulator whose extreme wealth finances puppet groups and publications to drain the prosperity of the Herrenvolk. This cannot be dismissed as the preoccupation of ignorable fools on the internet, nor as the equivalent of liberal criticism of the Koch Brothers. Instead, the attack on Soros follows classic anti-Semitic templates, grimly recurrent throughout western history, and some of the most powerful geopolitical figures in the world are pushing it. It’s fueled by Soros’s political activism against a revanchist right eager to view the world in zero-sum racial terms that is on the march across Europe, America and beyond. 

“It’s important to distinguish between intent and effect. Of course a person who shares a conspiracy theory about George Soros may not intend to promulgate anti-Semitism, and of course not every Soros conspiracy theory is anti-Semitic. But the image of the rich, powerful Jew who manipulates social and political movements around the world for his own agenda is an ancient anti-Semitic trope,” said Aryeh Tuchman, the associate director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism.

“Because Soros’s Jewish identity is so well known, we are concerned that conspiracy theories about George Soros may have the effect of reinforcing this trope and spreading it throughout the broader population,” Tuchman added. “This is especially true when other anti-Semitic tropes are woven in, such as claims that Soros controls the media or the banks, or when he is described using terms that harken back to medieval claims that Jews are evil, demonic, or agents of the Antichrist.”

                            Much like dual loyalty, globalist is used to promote the antisemitic conspiracy that Jewish people do not have allegiance to their countries of origin, like the United States, but to some worldwide order—like a global economy or international political system—that will enhance their control over the world’s banks, governments, and media (see control). The idea of a Jewish globalist was embedded in the core ideology of Nazism. Hitler often portrayed Jews as “international elements” who “conduct their business everywhere,” posing a threat to all people who are “bounded to their soil, to the Fatherland.” Today, globalist is a coded word for Jews who are seen as international elites conspiring to weaken or dismantle “Western” society using their international connections and control over big corporations (see New World Order)—all echoing the destructive theory that Jews hold greed and tribe above country.

                            A noteworthy anti-Semitic theme in 2017 was the use of the term “globalist” as an anti-Semitic slur. Although the term is not inherently anti-Semitic, “globalist” is often used as a pejorative term for people whose interests in international commerce or finance ostensibly make them disloyal to the country in which they live, or who are willing to undermine the financial security of their neighbors in order to benefit transnational interests. Because of the long history of anti-Semitic associations of Jews with money and commerce, and allegations that Jews place their transnational ethnic affiliations ahead of the interests of their non-Jewish neighbors, these pejorative subtexts quickly take on anti-Semitic connotations when the term is applied to individual Jews, groups of Jews, or places where Jews are known to live (i.e. “New York globalists”). Anti-Semites frequently use the term “Globalist” as a code word for Jews.

                            "Goody" was the short form of "Goodwife," an archaic honorific used to address women in England, Scotland, and the United States up until the 19th century. It was roughly equivalent to the modern "Ms." or "Mrs." since it was usually (but not always) applied to married women.

TERFs often use it before their surnames or account names (e.g., "Goody Rowling") as a reference to Goody Ann Glover, who, in 1688, was hanged as a witch in Boston, the last person to suffer such a fate in the city. The insinuation is that TERFs are also innocent women being persecuted by trans women in exceedingly vague and unverifiable ways.

                            Goy is the Hebrew word for "nation", and it appears numerous times in the Bible, usually in the phrase "goy kadosh", which directly translates to "holy nation". In modern contexts, however, it refers to anyone who is not Jewish. Among Hebrew- and Yiddish-speakers the term is standard for referring to non-Jews, and has no racist or xenophobic connotations. English-speakers often regard the word as derogatory, and may employ the terms "gentile" or "non-Jew" instead. Google's dictionary defines the term as informal and derogatory. The Oxford English Dictionary regards the noun as often pejorative, but not the adjective.

While Jewish people in the diaspora often frivolously use the term, the term is often employed by cranks, antisemites, and conspiracy theorists to make Jewish people sound racist. If someone uses the term "goy" in an argument having to do with the Federal Reserve, Israel, Zionism, or any other possible crank magnet, chances are you are arguing with a racist lunatic and it is not worth continuing. If they use any variation on the anti-semitic cliche "Oy vey, the goyim know, shut it down!", then those chances shoot up to a near-certainty.

There is a recurring canard among conspiracy theorists and antisemites alike that the term "goyim" means "cattle" in Hebrew. The actual Hebrew word for "cattle" is "bakar". As noted above, the word 'goy' translates to "nation", including that of Israel.

The term "shabbos goy" refers to a non-Jew who does work for Jews that observant Jews are otherwise not allowed to do during the Sabbath due to religious restrictions. Antisemites also often use the term to refer to people who are alleged to be doing the "dirty work" for the Jews.

                            it’s a dog whistle to the party’s most extreme, conspiracy-minded base. The foundation of the QAnon conspiracy theory is that there is a mass, secret, underground ring of Satanic pedophiles whose members consist of Democratic leaders and Hollywood elites. Painting anyone who opposes Florida’s law (i.e., mainly Democrats) as being pro-grooming fits neatly into that narrative and winks at QAnon adherents without requiring politicians on the right to actually endorse the outlandish theory.

But this rhetoric also harkens back to age-old attacks on the LGBTQ community. Casting LGBTQ people as child predators and their very existence as something inherently sexual was a tactic used by anti-LGBTQ activists since the 1970s in their efforts to stifle or roll back LGBTQ legal protections, according to Marie-Amélie George, a law professor at Wake Forest University who specializes in LGBTQ rights. George said that for a long time, many people believed that being gay was the result of child sexual abuse.

                            In her 2008 match-up against Obama for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton claimed that her white working-class support mad eher a stronger presidential contender. In that contest's waning days, Clinton used race to make a last ditch argument that she was more electable than Obama: "I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on," she explained in an interview, citing a recent poll that she said "found how Sen. Obama's support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how whites in both [Indiana and North Carolina] who had not completed college were supporting me." Clinton's equation of "hard-working Americans" with "white Americans" struck many as a form of intentional dog whistling. Perhaps it was, though maybe this linkage was merely an unconscious slip, even if one that revealed the cultural power of the stereotypes contrasting supposedly hardworking whites and lazy blacks.

                            Since the start of the pandemic, “medical freedom” and the related term “health freedom” have been used by prominent public figures including politicians and influencers. In October 2021, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and actress Candace Cameron Bure—D.J. Tanner from TV’s “Full House”—shared the most viral posts touting the idea…“Medical freedom” is an effective dog whistle for anti-vaxxers, and with its mainstreaming, it is becoming a potential gateway to anti-vax conspiracy theories. Hundreds of online communities flagging themselves as defenders of “health freedom” and “medical freedom” are a hotbed for conspiracy theories and medical misinformation: Events marked as “medical freedom” and “health freedom” occasionally signal anti-vax events or activities (e.g., seminars). Storyful has noted instances occurring on sites such as Eventbrite and AirBnB. For anti-vax activists the terms are an effective way to promote their arguments while avoiding spreading explicit misinformation. Some are using these arguments on “mainstream” platforms, while spreading blatant misinformation on platforms with loose moderation, such as Telegram.

                            Antisemitic dogwhistle politics references certain people, terms, and narratives that may appear vague and harmless without context, but which signal a form of antisemitic hate speech. Dog-whistle is constantly used as a tactic by QAnon to denounce prominent Jewish public figures and the global Jewry in ways that are all too familiar. Since the encoded language within QAnon might not be apparent at first sight, this aspect needs further explanation. In the following, this chapter will present most common QAnon conspiracy myths and show how they apply a coded or suggestive antisemitic language…

...By 2020, QAnon followers were advancing a story that “Hollywood elites” were engaged in “adrenochrome harvesting,” in which the hormone adrenaline is extracted from tortured children’s blood to be oxidized into the psychoactive drug adrenochrome…Many of the “Hollywood elites” accused of committing these crimes against children are not Jewish. QAnon believers accused, for instance, Oprah Winfrey of being a key figure in their alleged vast sex trafficking ring. Nonetheless, the critique of the “liberal Hollywood elites” is rooted in antisemitism. As early as in the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan complained about the “immoral films being produced by the ‘Jew-controlled’ Hollywood film industry.” The Dearborn Independent, a newspaper owned by industrialist Henry Ford, claimed that there was a “Jewish supremacy” which was under the control of the “Jewish manipulators of the public mind.” Even in the 1970s, Jews were accused by the American far-right of promoting “anti-Christian and anti-American pictures” (Gillis, 2017, pp. 267, 280). In 1964, 50% of Americans believed that “the Jews” controlled Hollywood; in 2008, this number went down to only 22%. But this is still a high number, as Anti-Defamation League chairman Abe Foxman pointed out. Although it is true that Jews are disproportionately represented in the American creative industry, Foxman said, the idea that “the Jews” control Hollywood is “very dangerous” (Stein, 2020). These antisemitic legends resonate well with QAnon’s claim of Hollywood actors harvesting adrenochrome from children.

                            A dog whistle used by TERFs on Tumblr as a replacement for "cis", usually in coded phrases like "hygienic female," "extremely hygienic," etc. The implication is that cis women are cleaner than trans women, playing on the stereotype that men have worse personal hygiene than women. TERFs of course view trans women as men. It's also based on a pathologization of transfeminine bottom surgery. TERFs are morbidly fixated on a form of vaginoplasty sometimes used in gender-confirmation surgery. This procedure involves colon tissue grafts, as this allows the vagina to be self-lubricating. TERFs are convinced that all trans women undergo this procedure, and thus that their vaginas must be smelly and gross. It's also been noted that the term "hygienic" has an extremely problematic history.

                            Identitarianism is a synonym for Nazism that sounds less Nazi-like. From the main Wikipedia page for "identitarianism":

The Identitarian movement or Identitarianism is a pan-European nationalist, far-right political ideology asserting the right of European ethnic groups and white peoples to Western culture and territories claimed to belong exclusively to them. Originating in France as Les Identitaires ("The Identitarians"), with its youth wing Generation Identity, the movement expanded to other European countries during the early 21st century. Building on ontological ideas of the German Conservative Revolution, its ideology was formulated from the 1960s onward by essayists such as Alain de Benoist, Dominique Venner, Guillaume Faye and Renaud Camus, who are considered the main ideological sources of the movement.

Identitarians promote concepts such as pan-European nationalism, localism, ethnopluralism, remigration, or the Great Replacement, and they are generally opposed to globalisation, multiculturalism, Islamization and extra-European immigration. Influenced by New Right metapolitics, they do not seek direct electoral results, but rather to provoke long-term social transformations and eventually achieve cultural hegemony and popular adhesion to their ideas.

                            Illegal immigrant" is supposed to describe someone who migrates to the US without legal authority. But it's in fact used to describe a particular group of people: Latinos, in particular Mexicans — even though many unauthorized immigrants can and do come from places outside Latin America.

In White Backlash, UC Berkeley political scientists Zoltan Hajnal and Marisa Abrajano noted the phenomenon: "Americans tend to reserve their most negative sentiments for so-called illegal immigrants, but when asked about immigrants as a whole, Mexican Americans, or even Latinos, the answers tend not to differ all that much."

Haney-López explained that this is a classic use of coded language. Since it's describing an action, politicians can say they're targeting criminal wrongdoing, not a certain group of people. But what they're really tapping into is fears of brown people flooding across the border and reshaping the US from the inside.

                            Historically, the Order of the Illuminati refers to a secret society founded in Bavaria by Adam Weishaupt in the late 18th to advocate for secularism. However, during the interwar period of the 20th century, fascist propaganda claimed the Illuminati were a subversive element which served Jewish elites who were behind global capitalism and Soviet communism (see Jewish capitalist, Jewish communist) and were plotting to create a New World Order (see New World Order). This conspiratorial stance on the Illuminati, as well as its related conspiracy theory of Freemason-controlling Jews, are built on classic antisemitic themes, including the notion of Jewish control over the world, the meddling by Jews in global politics, and the Jewish plot for complete power over world governance (see control).

                            "I Love J. K. Rowling" was once a sentiment shared by millions of Harry Potter fans. However, Rowling dropped the mask and revealed herself to be a TERF in late 2019, confirming years of speculation based on dodgy Twitter likes and follows. The phrase has since become a coded way for transphobes to propagate their views while seemingly expressing simple fondness of a popular author. Billboards and signs featuring the phrase have been commissioned by transphobes such as Kellie-Jay Keen-Minshull.[6][55] A cottage industry of stickers, shirts, and other junk featuring the phrase has sprung up. Now TERFS are more likely to enthusiastically proclaim their love of J. K. Rowling than Harry Potter fans. The variant "I Stand With Rowling" is also commonly used.

                            using the phrase "implicit bias" helps Clinton talk about racism in a way that may be easier for more conservative voters to accept, said Lauth, since it stems from subconscious prejudices that people are unaware they have. "The term implicit bias will satisfy a lot of people that are looking for a very explicit answer to the problem of police brutality," Lauth said. "It also helps her in walking that line between Blue Lives Matter and Black Lives Matter."

                            On a 2014 radio program Representative Paul Ryan made the following statement, which was criticized shortly after by fellow Representative Barbara Lee as a “thinly veiled racial attack”. The “thin veil” refers to the phrase inner-city, which is code or euphemism for African American neighborhoods (especially stereotypically racialized views of such neighborhoods). Those aware of the dogwhistle heard Ryan promulgate the pernicious racial stereotype that African Americans are lazy. At the same time, Ryan maintained an amount of plausible deniability because this content was not explicit but only referenced a vague geographical location.

After all, the supposed existence of a cabal of international Jewish bankers working to undermine US democracy is a recurring theme in American anti-Semitism, from Henry Ford’s The International Jew to Reddit troll-conventions. Trump’s choice of language serves as a signal that he is one of them.

Or at least, that’s what many commentators have alleged. The problem is that it’s hard to establish whether a piece of speech or writing is a dog whistle. Indeed, it’s not obvious what evidence could, in principle, settle a dispute over whether some expression is or isn’t one. They are, by their nature, sneaky things.

                            Lobbying groups by definition use their money to support specific causes. Individual Jewish groups use money through contributions, including campaign contributions, to draw support for various missions and causes, as do tens of thousands of other American lobbies and interest groups. There is no one “Jewish lobby” that speaks for the Jewish community. While some people use “Jewish Lobby” and “Israel Lobby” interchangeably and have no antisemitic intentions when saying “Jewish Lobby,” the phrase serves as a dog whistle for those who believe Jews control politics (see control). When “Jewish Lobby” is purposefully invoked to describe Jewish control of Washington, then that is antisemitic.

                            It's Okay to Be White was a poster campaign spearheaded by 4chan's /pol/ and other far-right groups, such as The Daily Stormer, in November 2017. This campaign counters the context of the perceived "reverse racism" and society trying to make a privileged majority "guilty", and it consoles the privileged majority: "it's okay to be white." By use of this loaded language, the campaign attempted to force critics to either accept the posters' message (despite being pushed by far-right white supremacist groups) or to say that "it's not okay to be white" (an obviously absurd and bigoted statement). The campaign has expected the posters to be taken down so "normies" can realize how the media hate white people and therefore try to recruit them to the white supremacist cause.

                            In the Christian Bible, Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus Christ for 30 pieces of silve. Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus’s 12 disciples, received 30 pieces of silver to betray Jesus to the religious authorities. Although Jesus and all 12 disciples were Jews, the Western world—through art, literature, music, and tradition—chose to depict Judas as the Jew who sold out his Savior for money. Thus, the name Judas became synonymous with traitor, contributing to the persecution of Jewish communities for two millennia. This false and libelous narrative would feed into Hitler’s propaganda and the Holocaust.

                            It might seem neighbourly, even pluralistic, to include Judaism in a declaration of purported Western values. But in reality this isn’t how the term has functioned, either historically or more recently. Instead, the phrase is used to exclude rather than include. Despite implying that Jews are part of this resurrection of Judeo-Christian values, Trump in no way intends a campaign to Make Hanukkah Great Again. His “Judeo-Christian values” are about protecting Christmas, and about protecting Christians – at the exclusion of others. “Judeo-Christian” is now most often used to draw a line between imagined Christian values and a perceived (but false) threat of Muslim immigration. 

Time and again, when Farage and Trump use the term, what they really imply is an “us-versus-them” division between the West and Islam. This is not about the inclusion of Jews in the values of these nations, then, but about the xenophobic exclusion of an “other”. Invoked in anti-immigration rhetoric with the goal of excluding Muslims, this phrase is actually used to scaffold a false narrative about Christians being persecuted, threatened or besieged, which gives motivation for the protection of “Judeo-Christian values”. In fact, Christians are not persecuted in the countries where Farage and Trump make their homes.

                            Jwoke refers to a person who is antisemitic, who is woke to various conspiracy theories about Jews and/or to the Jewish question. JQ Aware, derived from Jewish Question, is sometimes used as a synonym. The Jewish question (abbreviated JQ) was part of a long-running debate in Europe about the civil, legal, national and political status of Jews within Europe from the 18th through 20th centuries. It culminated in Nazi Germany with The Final Solution, resulting in the Holocaust. The alt-right has revived the term even though there are some Jews who consider themselves among the alt-right.

                            The Kalergi Plan is an antisemitic conspiracy theory that was invented by neo-Nazi Austrian Gerd Honsik (1941–2018), and propagated in his 2005 book, Rassismus Legal. The plan alleges a conspiracy that centers around Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi (1899–1972), the founder of the Paneuropean Union. Coudenhove-Kalergi was an Austrian politician whose father was an Austro-Hungarian diplomat and whose mother was Japanese. Coudenhove-Kalergi was initially antisemitic, like his father. After he began researching his book, Das Wesen des Antisemitismus, however, he concluded that antisemitism was primarily based on religious bigotry, and subsequently ceased to be an antisemite. In his 1925 book, Praktischer Idealismus, Coudenhove-Kalergi wrote, "Der Mensch der fernen Zukunft wird Mischling sein. Die heutigen Rassen unt Kasten werden der zunehmenden Überwindung von Raum, Zeit und Vorurteil zum Opfer fallen." which has been translated into English as: "The man of the future will be of mixed race. Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice." Coudenhove-Kalergi's forecast was an optimistic view of racial-mixing that contrasted with Madison Grant's similar but pessimistic and racist view.

The conspiracy theory itself alleges that Coudenhove-Kalergi wanted the envisioned mixed-race world to be ruled by Jewish elites, and that one of Coudenhove-Kalergi's goals was the destruction of Europe. This conspiracy theory overlaps with the white genocide and Great Replacement conspiracy theories among neo-Nazis.

                            The term "Kek" originates from World of Warcraft, where if someone from the Horde side typed "lol" in /say, Alliance players would instead see "kek". This is a further reference by Blizzard to the Korean language word for 'laugh' (or more literally, 'ha ha ha'), kekeke (ㅋㅋㅋ), commonly seen in Starcraft. Used the same way by 4chan, later leading to the discovery of an Egyptian deity by the same name who happened to be a frog, thus linking this to the Pepe meme. The superlative is "topkek" or "top kek," which is also reference to a Turkish snack food. Kekistan is a fictional ethnicity that lets alt-righters use a Nazi flag as a "meme". It replaces the Nazi symbol with "K"s, and the Iron Cross with 4chan's logo. Kekistan was popularized in part by Sargon of Akkad.

                            In the 6th century CE, the Khazars—an obscure warlike tribe in Turkistan [present day Kazakhstan]—fought for land that was ultimately overtaken by Southern Russia and Ukraine. Despite the decline in population and territorial defeat, the Khazars continued to be mentioned throughout history— especially as one of the first groups to adopt Judaism. By the 8th or 9th century, antisemitic conspiracy theories began forming around the Khazars’ reported conversion to Judaism. This spurred antisemitic beliefs that they were building a secret empire which sought widespread control through financial gains. Given that the Khazars moved into and settled in Eastern Europe, antisemites push the conspiracy that Ashkenzai Jews—Jews descending from Eastern Europe—are not “real Jews” and are working to infiltrate other nations on their quest for world domination (see “not the real Jews”). The Khazar trope is also used to undermine the Jewish connection to Israel, and therefore Israel’s right to exist, because it falsely says Jews originated from the northern Caucasus region and were part of the Turkic empire—and not the Land of Israel.

                            [Everyday Feminism] “Law and order” is often used to police low-income communities, particularly Black and Latinx people. Politicians use the phrase to signal that people of color are inherently criminal, and that we defy laws for no good reason. It implies that extra measures, such as broken windows policing, which promotes harsh punishment strategies under the belief that tolerating minor infractions encourages more serious violent crimes, need to be implemented in order to uphold the law.

Richard Nixon used the rhetoric of “law and order” in 1968 to appeal to white voters who were angry about integration. He claimed that he was a candidate for the “silent majority,” the other population of whites who weren’t protesting social injustices like Jim Crow and the Vietnam War.

With the exception of Trump saying we need more “law and order,” which would directly impact Black and Latinx neighborhoods, the phrase isn’t used much anymore. However, the message behind it still resonates with conservatives and liberals alike.  When groups like Black Lives Matter use civil disobedience, like when they shut down the 405 Freeway in Inglewood, CA last year, similar rhetoric to “law and order” was used to police their actions. Liberals and conservatives alike objected to BLM because they claimed that the protests were “disrupting people’s lives” and “promoting rioting and violence.” In that case, upholding the status quo and obeying the law was the most important thing, instead of recognizing that the laws are unjust and need to be fixed.

Its proponents insist that granting legal recognition and protection to trans people will somehow force cis lesbians to date "men" (i.e., trans women) and thus nullify the existence of lesbians, or because lesbians are somehow being convinced to become trans men. This conspiracy has been propagated by mainstream newspapers in the UK.

                            While discrimination and fear of lesbians do exist, this term is more often used by TERFs as a dog whistle against male-to-female transgender people, and it is also often used to gatekeep trans women from women's spaces. As with other terms here, it has, of course, made it harder for non-transphobic lesbians to talk about legitimate discrimination against lesbians, and to describe how it differs from homophobia against gay men. Among non-TERFs the more inclusive, gender-neutral term homophobia is preferred in most cases when not referring to the intersection of misogyny and homophobia proper, whereas TERFs often use the term lesbophobia specifically to attack trans people and the broader LGBT community.

                            Let's Go Brandon is a meme that sounds vaguely like the phrase "Fuck Joe Biden". Its origins are traced to a post-race interview with NASCAR racer, Brandon Brown on October 2, 2021. Brandon was celebrating his win with an interview on NBC. During the interview, a crowd chanted out "Fuck Joe Biden" loud and clear. To feebly cover for this obscenity on live TV, the interviewer claimed, "You can hear the chants from the crowd, 'Let's go, Brandon!'" Since the interview, the phrase "Let's Go Brandon" has been amplified by the alt-right as a way to curse Biden, but it has also been used by ostensibly mainstream right-wing figures.

                            The salamander has become a "positive symbol" for a subset of the detrans community due to its ability to regenerate lost limbs and organs. These detransitioners are mostly cis women who identified as trans men for a time and now regret receiving HRT, top surgery, or hysterectomies. They have stated that, although certain aspects of medical transition cannot be reversed, they wish to "feel emotionally and psychologically complete."

Not all detransitioners are TERFs. However, the lizard emoji is often seen as a TERF dogwhistle. Psychologist and author Devon Price has cautioned that one should be "very skeptical and on alert" if they see someone with a "lizard in their bio" on social media commenting on "gender, sexuality, 'protecting children,' feminism, or trans issues." Price has written about his own brief experience with detransition. Ky Schevers, another prominent retransitioner and ex-TERF, has linked the lizard emoji's symbolism to TERF erasure of tran men: "Autotomy is when some animals, like lizards & sea cucumbers, shed a body part in order to escape from a predator & then later regrow the lost part. The idea was that detrans women had shed their femaleness to try to escape the dangers of patriarchy but were now regrowing it." TERFs frequently argue that cis women transition in an attempt to escape misogyny or lesbophobia.

Which, of course, was really just a twisted vision of a racist past, a vision shaped by vicious dog whistles that spoke so clearly to white supremacists and neo-Nazis that some of them, such as David Duke, hailed Trump’s victory in the 2016 presidential election as a long-awaited legitimization of their views.

                            Coded language can also be used for white people, in particular to signal support for white supremacy. One such example is the phrase "middle class," which is often deployed by conservative politicians to refer not just to members of the middle class, but to white members of the middle class in particular.

"'Middle class' stands as a signifier for whites," Haney-López argued. "It stands in opposition to the word 'poor,' which over the last 40 or 50 years has come to be associated with people of color."

"Middle class" also stands in contrast to "inner city" and "urban," which were deployed after white flight out of the cities and into the suburbs during the 1950s and '60s.

"If you had to live near, work with, or send your children to school with blacks, you weren't actually middle class," Haney-López said. "You needed to leave the city and move out to the suburbs. That was an economic marker, but it was also a racial marker of your middle-class status, because you were physically distant from African Americans."

It is a classic example of coded language. There are of course many, many middle-class black Americans. But because of how the term has been used over time, it's attained a different, pernicious meaning — one that politicians and media have subtly embraced to play up likeness to and contrast from people of certain demographics.

                            For members of the far-right, dairy milk represents strength of body and ties into their ideas of masculinity. Conversely, soy and other forms of milk have come to symbolize weakness and effeminacy. In our analysis, we found that milk has been used as a thinly veiled allegory for racial purity. Several prominant figures from the white supremacist movement including Richard Spencer added milk bottle emojis to their Twitter profiles. The hashtags #MilkTwitter embraced and celebrated traditional gender norms and white-dominated patriarchy, while making fun of multiculturalism and feminism. Scholars such as Freeman (2013) contend that the contemporary white supremacist movement appropriated the long association of milk with the intellect. She points out that since the consumption of liberal amounts of milk and its products are associated with having a scientific mind and excelling in other intellectual activities, white supremacists appropriated it to convey their superiority among the racial groups.

                            Milk, emojified as 🥛, is another dogwhistle similar to 👌. This dogwhistle originated from a 4chan thread centering around a Nature article about a genetic mutation in Europe that caused lactase production and eliminated lactose intolerance in adulthood. Ironically, a similar mutation arose independently in Africa. Whether as a form of dimwittery or trolling, some in the alt-right have also in engaged in milk chugging.

                            "Mixed sex" can have at least two different meanings: Any environment that accommodates both trans and cis women, since TERFs see trans women as men. A term used in place of "unisex" or "gender neutral" when referring to bathrooms anyone can use. TERFs think that this makes it sound worse, and will make others realize that cis women should only ever have to share facilities with other cis women, no one else.

                            A phrase claiming that trans women are just "dressing up" as women and it's a "costume" they can take off whenever convenient. Taken from a campaign that began as an anti-racism initiative in colleges, asking students not to wear Halloween costumes based on ethnic stereotypes: "We're a culture, not a costume." It later used the slogan "My identity is not a costume" and expanded to include other marginalised groups, with one poster showing a trans woman objecting to a crude costume based on Caitlyn Jenner. At this point the slogan and concept were hijacked by TERFs.

                            And the term neoliberal doesn’t mean a faction of liberals. It now refers to liberals generally, and it is applied by their left-wing critics. The word is now ubiquitous, popping up in almost any socialist polemic against the Democratic Party or the center-left. Obama’s presidency? It was “the last gasp of neoliberalism.” Why did Hillary Clinton lose? It was her neoliberalism. Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz? Neoliberals both.

The ubiquitous epithet is intended to separate its target — liberals — from the values they claim to espouse. By relabeling self-identified liberals as “neoliberals,” their critics on the left accuse them of betraying the historic liberal cause.

Its basic claim is that, from the New Deal through the Great Society, the Democratic Party espoused a set of values defined by, or at the very least consistent with, social democracy or socialism. Then, starting in the 1970s, a coterie of neoliberal elites hijacked the party and redirected its course toward a brand of social liberalism targeted to elites and hostile to the interests of the poor and the working class.

The Democratic Party has evolved over the last half-century, as any party does over a long period of time. But the basic ideological cast of its economic policy has not changed dramatically since the New Deal. American liberals have always had some room for markets in their program. Democrats, accordingly, have never been a left-wing, labor-dominated socialist party. (Union membership peaked in 1955, two decades before the party’s supposed neoliberal turn, and has declined steadily since.) They have mediated between business and labor, supporting expanded state power episodically rather than dogmatically. The widespread notion that “neoliberals” have captured the modern Democratic party and broken from its historic mission plays upon nostalgia for a bygone era, when the real thing was messier and more compromised than the sanitized historical memory.

The sudden ubiquity of the term in American politics — at least among left-wing elites — owes itself to two new developments. First, the Bernie Sanders campaign has inspired a new movement to remake the Democratic Party as a social-democratic labor party. Left-wing activists need a label for their opponents.

Second, the widely publicized influence of neoconservatives within the Bush administration changed the connotation of “neo.” Whereas the prefix had once softened the term it modified — the neoconservatives were once seen as the intellectually evolved wing of the right, in contrast to the Buchananite knuckle-draggers — by the end of Bush’s term, it became an intensifier. A neoconservative was a conservative, but an even scarier one.

And so the term neoliberal frames the political debate in a way that perfectly suits the messaging needs of left-wing critics of liberalism. The uselessness of “neoliberalism” as an analytic tool is the very thing that makes it useful as a factional messaging device for the left. The “neoliberalism” rubric implicates the Democratic Party in the rightward drift of American politics that has in reality been caused by the Republican Party’s growing radicalism. It yokes the two parties together into a capitalist Establishment, against which socialism offers the only clear alternative. Obscuring the large gulf between Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton, Paul Ryan and Barack Obama, is a feature of the term.

So that was part of the anti-fascist coalition.

                            The conspiracy of a small group of powerful individuals working in secret to establish all-powerful control. The New World Order conspiracy theory becomes antisemitic when it’s followed by a reference to a Jewish business leader or political official with a secret agenda who’s seeking global control. A widely-used conspiracy theory made popular in the 20th century, the term centers on a cabal of world leaders using the global stage to create an almighty, totalitarian regime that strips people of their individual liberties and consolidates power at the very top (see cabal). The conspiracy theory behind the New World Order involving Jewish leaders is based on the idea that Jews have formed a power structure in which they control every aspect of humankind—the economy, media, and political landscape (see control).

                            Ideas about the “Eastern Establishment,” “East Coast liberals,” and “New York elites”—terms widely used by conservatives of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly when they criticized the allegedly liberal news media— were in part planted by the anti-Semitic far right, for whom such terms meant one thing: powerful Jews, including the Jews who they believed controlled the broadcast and print news media. Such code words were used intentionally by anti-Semites and unintentionally by non-anti-Semites, who had absorbed ideas and rhetoric about East Coast liberals that originated from anti-Semitic beliefs but over time had lost explicit anti-Semitic connotations...

...Newspapers and writers that navigated the anti-Semitic hazy borderlines in the 1970s employed code words such as “invisible government,” “international finance,” and “international cabal” to allude to a communist world conspiracy, but they usually avoided making explicit references to Jews…Such publications and columnists in the anti-Semitic hazy borderlines also employed color-blind language and anti-Semitic code words when they criticized the news media. Terms such as the “Eastern Establishment,” “New York elites,” and “East Coast liberals” were used to describe the allegedly biased news media by both explicit anti-Semites and publications and columnists that existed in the hazy borderlines.

                            Antisemitism is often expressed in dog whistle terms, which are picked up by those familiar with the main concepts of Antisemitism but not by the populace as a whole. Examples are talk about the "controlled" media (without specifying who controls it, but anti-Semites know "who" that means); "international (often central) bankers" (without specifying Jewish international or central bankers, but anti-Semites know who); etc. Similarly, there is the originally Stalinist denunciation of "cosmopolitanism" or "rootless cosmopolitan", and more general references to "citizens of nowhere", "international elites", etc…Other seemingly-innocent terms include "New York intellectual" and variations. Other antisemitic dog whistles in German language sources include bemoaning the huge influence of ("certain people" on) the "East Coast [of the US]". Or more broadly, the term "Coastal elites", while it may not exclusively refer to Jews (it can also be a dog-whistle for liberals residing in coastal states), can also be invoked in reference to Jews or an "Israel Lobby" that "stifles debate" or "controls the media".

                            Several commentators, including former talk-show host Geraldo Rivera, are blasting Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz’s remarks earlier this year about “New York values” as anti-Semitic. Rivera, who is Jewish, said Thursday night on “The O’Reilly Factor” that Cruz’s use of the term “New York values” has “stinking anti-Semitic implications.”Asked about the remarks Friday morning on “Fox & Friends,” Rivera said, “In terms of this Ted Cruz situation and this ‘New York values’ situation, when you say ‘New York, money, and media,’ what do you need really before you get to the caricature — the dog-whistle — the code-word, of what this man is trying to say?” “What do you need? A cartoon of someone with a big nose from another era?” he asked, according to Salon. “This was designed to bring to the heartland the negative impression of greedy New Yorkers trying to take money out of people’s pockets.”

CNN legal analyst and New Yorker writer Jeffrey Toobin also mentioned the anti-Semitic overtones of the phrase in an appearance on CNN with Wolf Blitzer. “He said New York values are about money and they’re about the media. That’s an anti-Semitic trope from a hundred years. It’s been around for a very long time,” Toobin said, according to the Jerusalem Post. “Money and media is Jews. I mean this is just an old-fashioned, anti-Semitic stereotype, derogatory term and everybody understands it.”

                            A term used in gaming, meaning "non-player character," the alt-right attempted to appropriate it to dehumanize their opponents in October 2018, supposedly as a way to mock the abbreviation "PC" (as in "Person of Color" or "politically correct"). It is used in a similar manner to "SJW", the implication being that like NPCs in role-playing games or video games, left-wingers are scripted and brainwashed, regurgitate the same old talking points on a loop, and lack the ability to think critically. The meme culminated in a flood of spam accounts and bots on Twitter, each one having a username like "NPC93457234" (always 8 digits) and the same grey avatar or the Wojak avatar, posting typical straw men arguments of the left. The Wojak avatar originated in 2018 on 4chan in an attempt to dehumanize SJWs. This eventually morphed into said accounts tweeting out a message to go vote in the midterm elections on November 7th 2018 and not the day before, when the election actually was held. Twitter eventually banned approximately 1,500 accounts in response to this disinformation campaign in late October 2018.

In 1903, the antisemitic forgery, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, alleged, among many other falsities, that Jewish leaders were conspiring to control the world, including global politics, the world economy, and the media. The image of an octopus, with its tentacles wrapped around the world, or penetrating the globe, is an antisemitic representation of this canard.

                            The OK Hand Sign, emojified as 👌, is a dogwhistle that alt-righters use to show that they are alt-right without explicitly stating it, echoing both Trump's and Pepe's usage of the sign. The alt-right use originated as bait for a /pol/ "prank" or trolling attempt, but as the media failed to fall into the trap, its usage rapidly shed whatever irony it had. As of January 2018, Snopes has listed the symbol as ambiguous as to whether it is an alt-right symbol or alt-right trolling. The sign is also used relatively innocuously in the "Circle Game". What makes it so devious is that it can be very difficult to know if someone is using it as a dogwhistle or as a harmless hand sign.

                            Over the past few years, mainstream environmentalists and climate activists have watched with alarm as a new brand of right-wing eco-consciousness has started to gain traction in the United States and western Europe. On its extreme edge, proponents have explicitly embraced the label of “eco-fascism.” The alleged perpetrator of this month’s mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, claimed this identity, as did those in the 2019 El Paso, Texas, and Christchurch, New Zealand, massacres. Each blamed migrants, and people of color in general, for denigrating nature, and claimed that killing to lower population numbers was helpful for the environment – a clear throwback, scholars say, to Nazi rhetoric. 

In 1968, a bestselling book by Stanford professor Paul Ehrlich, “The Population Bomb,” predicted that a growing number of humans would lead to everything from global famine to world war. It helped usher in years of environmental ideology focused on the alleged problem of “too many people.”

But as Dr. Hartmann and other scholars have pointed out, that “too many” was rarely conceptualized as white Anglo-Saxons. Indeed, the whole concept of overpopulation had roots in the early 20th-century eugenics movement, which advocated building a “superior” human race through selective breeding – an approach that was deeply racist. 

In recent years, most mainstream environmental organizations have backed away from, and even apologized for, their focus on overpopulation during the ’60s and ’70s. But the rhetoric still comes up regularly in conversations about climate, says Jacquelyn Gill, a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. This is despite clear research that shows fossil fuel use in wealthier, whiter countries has had a far greater climate impact than the number of people in any high-birthrate nation.

“It’s really hard to get people to accept that consumption is the problem, not how many people there are,” Dr. Gill says. “And that when we talk about overpopulation, there’s a dog whistle there that a lot of people don’t even realize that they’re blowing.”

                            "Oy vey" is a Yiddish expression of dismay. The alt-right is fond of ironically using "oy vey", because it makes them feel edgy. "Oy vey" is seen in "Oy vey, the goyim know, shut it down." (implying that Jews are part of a worldwide shadowy conspiracy) or "Oy vey, remember the 6 trillion." (implying that the Holocaust was faked to guilt-trip people into supporting some "Jewish agenda").

Oy vey! is a common expression among Jews in the Yiddish language to express dismay or exasperation. Oy vey in the English language means "oh, woe!" or "woe is me". It has become part of a stereotypical Jewish vocabulary along with the likes of "shalom" and "mazel tov". Even among non-Yiddish speakers and non-Jews, it is a very familiar Jewish saying.

Originally, the word had no racist connotations and was used by both Jews and non-Jews. Recently though the word has been misappropriated and co-opted by the alt-right and by Anti-Semites as a way of mocking Jewish people and even to vandalise Jewish gravestones. "Oy vey, it's anuddah shoah!" has become a common way to mock any allegation of antisemitism. It is often used in conjunction with other anti-Semitic terms such as "the goyim know", "shekels" and "remember the 6 gorillion"". Just like Goy, "oy vey" has become an anti-Semitic term to demonize Jews, in this case for what the alt-right perceives as being part of a conspiracy. However, because of Poe's Law, it can be very difficult to distinguish ironic uses of "oy vey" and unironic uses, so be careful of distinguishing between the two uses.

                            Pajeet is a slur, often used by the alt-right to mock Indians. The word is derived from paaji (elder brother in Punjabi) + generic Punjabi name (Sanjeet, Manjeet etc). It is almost always used with "jokes" about how Indians defecate in the open, citing out-of-date UNICEF statistics. "Designated shitting streets" and "Poo in loo" are variants of this, the former mocking a supposedly Indian user "defending" cases of open defecation, the latter mocking a comically titled UNICEF video intended to raise awareness on the matter. The term is also used by the Indian alt-right.

                            As it is used today, “personal responsibility” is a term that appears race-neutral on its face, but many Americans likely hear it as coded language signaling opposition to a welfare system they believe benefits minorities at the expense of majorities. King and Smith (2014) argue that in the wake of the 1960s civil rights laws arguments about racial policy shifted “from debates over segregation versus integration to disputes between colorbind and race-conscious policy choices” (958). “Personal responsibility” as color-blind but racially coded language can be seen in Ronald Reagan’s rhetoric surrounding welfare queens (Cammett 2014, 2016). While King and Smith (2014) highlight the advantages of color-blind rhetoric for conservative coalition building and Republican electoral campaigns, this rhetorical tool was also used by Democrats such as Bill Clinton in his welfare reform of 1996 (Cammett 2016; Pappas 1996). The net effect of this dog whistle was to paint using welfare as a failure of personal responsibility with the unspoken implication that the failure was most acute on the part of Black Americans and the undeserving poor (Gilens 2009). Thus, the very concept of “personal responsibility” needs to be understood as a strategic dog whistle used by politicians to signal opposition to expanding the welfare state on the grounds that “irresponsible” Black Americans would abuse it.

                            [Poisoning the well is] a smear tactic in which an opponent introduces negative information about their adversaries in order to discredit them. The term derives from the ancient war tactic of poisoning an opponent’s water to diminish his strength. “Poisoning the well,” an accusation rooted in the 14th century Bubonic Plague, blames Jews for purposefully spreading disease. As the Black Death spread across Europe, Jews were accused of spreading the infection through common drinking wells. Thousands of innocent Jews were murdered in response. This trope can be found on all sides of the political spectrum— from Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf, which accused Jews of being “vermin” and spreading bacteria, to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan’s diatribes labeling Jews as “termites” also spreading disease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Jews were blamed by alternative figures on various far-right fringe platforms for creating and/or purposefully spreading COVID-19. This trope reached a more mainstream audience on the far-left, where political cartoons and statements were made saying Israel (or “Zionists”) created COVID-19 in order to hurt the Palestinians and/or profit off the vaccine.

                            Donald Trump’s path to the U.S. presidency in 2016 was paved with warnings about political correctness. Trump railed against it in his campaigning, while also famously referring to Mexicans as “rapists” and calling for a Muslim ban. Since then, it has become clear to increasing numbers of Americans that Trump’s attacks on political correctness are a form of racially coded messaging used to stoke the fires of the grievances and fear some White people feel. White power extremists have always heard these racist dog whistles loud and clear.

For some, political correctness remains a much needed corrective to structural racism and the sorts of identity-based injustices that have returned to public focus during the Trump administration—especially after the killing of African American George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May. However, more often, the term is used in a negative manner, particularly by those on the right, to warn against Orwellian groupthink and threats to freedom of thought and speech. In the U.S., the term “political correctness” burst into public discussion in the 1990s as part of a conservative critique that claimed identity politics was shutting down debate, especially in universities. A 1990 New York Times essay, “The Rising Hegemony of the Politically Correct,” by the journalist Richard Bernstein, helped spark a controversy that has raged ever since. Of course, not everyone who attacks political correctness is a White power sympathizer.

                            A person's "power level" indicates how deeply someone has fallen into fascist ideology. Internet Nazis often advise each other to "hide their power level" when speaking to those outside the fold, so as to avoid scaring away potential recruits with overt Nazi rhetoric or symbols (milk before meat). When a person uses such rhetoric in a public setting, they are "revealing their power level". The phrase comes from the Dragon Ball media franchise, and is also generally used on 4chan to describe one's knowledge of a topic, usually "nerd stuff" (so, in a non-Nazi usage, "hiding power level" may refer to not revealing too much about one's knowledge of video games, comic books, anime and other topics).

                            Freedom of association, Goldwater explained, meant the right of individuals to be free from government coercion in choosing whom to let onto their property—but in the South this meant first and foremost the right of business ownders to exclude blacks from hotels, restaurants, movie theaters, and retail establishments…

Goldwater sought assistance trimming his language, enlisting a Phoenix lawyer named William Rehnquist to help write the speech. Rehnquist was an outspoken critic of civil rights, with a track record going back to Brown itself. When that case was first argued, Rehnquist had been a law clerk to one of the justices hearing it, and had written a memo urging that segregation be upheld, averring that “Plessy v Ferguson was write and should be re-affirmed”. But in the decade since, Rehnquist had moderated his language, and by 1964 he couched his opposition to civil rights as support for property rights (that is, the right of property owners to discriminate racially), making him an ideal choice to help Goldwater recalibrate his message. Entitled “Civil Rights and the Common Good”, the talk reprised the property rights argument, but also took another rhetorical turn, masterfully co-opting the language of civil rights to oppose integration as a moral evil.

It also includes other services in which single-sex provision is crucial to the promotion of the physical safety, health, privacy, and dignity of women and girls.

                            For many whites, ‘public school’ itself operates as a dog whistle term, connoting a dangerous nonwhite place that consumes vast resources yet fails to educate masses of young delinquents. This connotation traces back to the civil rights era when conservatives framed integration as making schools unsafe for white children, and over the decades—as whites fled, schools resegregated, and student bodies in many districts became almost exclusively nonwhite—this ulterior meaning has only grown more potent…conservative dog whistling blasts along: government serves minorities, and fails them; liberalism wastes white tax dollars; fear government, trust the market.

Passmore said these include, “The Jew as imposter, the Jew as globalist, the Jew as thief, the Jew as trickster pulling the strings, the Jew as disruptor of our realization as a nation, as a people, or of our way of life.”

                            The term "radical Islam" is supposed to refer to those who are so extreme in their view of Islam that they are willing to carry out deadly terrorist attacks. But this term has taken a new shape to stoke fears of Islam and Muslim people as a whole.

The most concrete proof of this is that fears over radical Islam have been used by many politicians to push for policies that broadly target Muslims. For example, on the presidential campaign trail, Jeb Bush called for preferential treatment of Syrian refugees who are Christian while having Muslims go through a more restrictive process, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul voted for a legislative amendment that would halt all immigration from dozens of Muslim countries with terrorist networks, and Donald Trump called for an all-out ban on Muslims traveling to the US.

Again, all these policies, as politicians describe them, are meant to fight "radical Islam." But they end up targeting all Muslims, even though most of them want nothing to do with extremism or terrorism.

                            Another way to complain about minorities without offense is to complain about ghettos, the bad part of town, etc. Or if one's a politician, "fixing" the impoverished areas of a city will do the trick (alternatively, "cleaning up our streets"). Particularly in the Midwest, it's common for people to mock places like Detroit, Cleveland, and the South Side of Chicago as it sounds innocent to the untrained ear.

                            In the battle over LGBTQ rights over the past few years, one term that has increasingly popped up in the public dialogue is "religious freedom." The term is purposely broad to imply that people are fighting for their general religious rights — when it's actually about protecting someone's "religious freedom" to discriminate against LGBTQ people.

The case of Rowan County, Kentucky, clerk Kim Davis shows the term's coded use. Davis and her supporters argued that she was merely standing up for her religious freedom. But what she was actually standing up for was her ability to deny same-sex couples their constitutional right to marry by refusing to let her government office issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

Similarly, advocacy groups have pushed "religious freedom" laws around the country to allow discrimination — particularly in restaurants and other places that serve the public — against LGBTQ people. (Legal experts, however, argue these laws could not be used to legally justify discrimination.)

"Religious freedom," then, is a term that sounds good on its face, since Americans by and large support letting people practice their chosen faith in peace. But given the context in which it's commonly used, it now carries an anti-LGBTQ sentiment to it, also implying LGBTQ people are inherently antithetical to religion itself.

                            Remove kebab originates from the nickname given to a propaganda video, which is also commonly called Serbia Strong, though the actual title in Serbian is Караџићу, води Србе своје / Karadžiću, vodi Srbe svoje (Karadžić, Lead Your Serbs), and is also known as Бог је Србин и он ће нас чувати / Bog je Srbin i on će nas čuvati (God Is a Serb and He Will Protect Us). The video repeatedly pops up on YouTube even though it was banned. It was produced by three Bosnian Serb soldiers in tribute to Radovan Karadžić, who was convicted for war crimes against Bosnian Muslims. The accordionist in the recording, Novislav Đajić, was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment for the murder of 14 people during the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. A still frame of Đajić’s face from the recording (he’s in military fatigues and playing an accordion), subsequently became a 4chan meme, known as "Dat Face Soldier".

In short: the "remove kebab" alt-right concept of the song positively references the killing, expulsion, and genocide of Muslims ("kebabs"). And yes, they think it's edgy. The proper response may be found in Polandball.The phrase received more mainstream media attention after its use by the perpetrator of the Christchurch terrorist attacks.

                            The anti-GMO movement has notably used rhetoric around "informing" people as dog whistles. "Just label it" and "right to know" are frequent rallying cries used, despite many leaders in the movement admitting that the push for GMO labelling is nothing more than a tactic for the complete elimination of the practice of genetic engineering in the food industry. A more egregious example would be the co-opting of the latter phrase by the organization US Right To Know, which is actually an organic industry front group that has been more focused on harassing scientists than giving the public valuable information.

                            Used to put a warm, fuzzy glow on policies aimed at busting unions and obliterating workplace safety and employee rights. These are particularly nasty examples, as they're carefully crafted to appeal to the people they hurt most, like unemployed and under-employed blue-collar workers. The upshot of such laws is often to create or exacerbate a negative externality, wherein the owners' gain greater profit at the workers' expense.

                            Alongside symbols, emojis, and hashtags, a large number of white supremacist accounts utilized insignia of ancient Rome and imagery from medieval ages to tie their current movements to the past. These images included leaders of the French Revolution to the architects of US monuments who symbolized their bygone power and legitimacy. Little (2018) shows how by using letters from the medieval alphabet as symbols in uniforms or flags, white supremacist emphasize that Europe is the “ancestral homeland” of white people like them and no one else. These symbols or flags often reappeared in memes, while images representing medieval events were often tweeted by the accounts we studied. Despite ample evidence that medieval Europe was in fact diverse and multicultural, historical accounts have been criticized for underrepresenting this diversity (cf., Kim, 2019; Little, 2018). Consequently, historical accounts, imagery, and symbols from that time are used to emphasize the supposed whiteness of Europe during these times and the idea that contemporary white supremacists must fight to reclaim this “ancestral homeland.”

                            What is less well known is that charges of “rootless cosmopolitanism”, “citizen of nowhere”, and “international elite”, are anti-semitic tropes, which have been used throughout the 20th century to cast aspersions on Jews. Soviet anti-Semites in the 1940s and 1950s used the term “rootless cosmopolitan” to refer to Jewish intellectuals, who were regarded as not being committed enough to the Soviet Union. The caricature of the cosmopolitan Jew was someone who was very rich, and who was at home everywhere and nowhere. We can go even further back, into the Weimar Republic, where Hitler and others used charges of cosmopolitanism against Jews, pitting them against the native-born population, described by Hitler in his 1933 campaign speech to Siemens factory workers as “people [who] are bounded to their soil, bounded to its fatherland, bounded to the possibilities of life that the state … offers”. By contrast, Hitler described Jews as “…a small, rootless, international clique that is turning the people against each other, that does not want them to have peace. It is the people who are at home both nowhere and everywhere, who do not have anywhere a soil on which they have grown up, but who live in Berlin today, in Brussels tomorrow, Paris the day after that, and then again in Prague or Vienna or London, and who feel at home everywhere.”

                            There's a hidden meaning to the call for "local control" of schools that you might not understand unless you're familiar with the resistance to desegregation.

After Brown v. Board of Education...in some places, the desegregation efforts consisted of, basically, striking all references to race but otherwise doing little else to end desegregation.  The "white" high school was no longer legally the white high school, but still had a nearly all-white student body, and the same went for the "black" high school.  In these districts, the DOJ eventually had to sue the district in federal court and have a federal judge order the school district to comply with Brown -- in some cases, these lawsuits continued for decades.  In districts that were sued to desegregate, so long as the lawsuit was still pending (meaning that a federal judge had not declared the school system to be unitary), even the smallest change to attendance boundaries would have to be approved by a federal judge before it could go into effect.  And forget about opening a new school or closing a school -- those had to be approved as well.  In some cases, judges even took the step of ordering changes to attendance boundaries or school closings -- frequently, the latter step would be taken to close the old black school and send the students to the old white school once it became clear that the resistance to desegregation among the white population was too strong to integrate the school district any other way.  (When this happened, white flight was the usual result -- once federal courts overcame the resistance to desegregation, whites would frequently send their children to private schools or move to a nearby school district that had fewer black students in it.)

So, Republican calls for "local control" of schools hearken back to the massive white resistance to desegregation.  Local control, in their parlance, meant freeing the school district from control by a federal judge.  Now it's frequently used as an assault on federal mandates like Common Core and No Child Left Behind, but the history of the term makes it clear that, at least to some people, "local control" is a dog whistle in the same vein as "state's rights."

                            RWDS is an acronym for Right Wing Death Squads. Alt-righters hope for right wing death squads so that their enemies (communists, black people, Muslims and Jews) can be killed. Like many alt-right memes it is indistinguishable from parody and therefore can be misinterpreted as a joke

                            In the United Kingdom and Ireland, "safeguarding" refers to measures designed to protect children, youth, and vulnerable adults from abuse and neglect. TERFs in the UK have co-opted the term as a euphemism for their crusade against young people's access to transition care. In December 2020, they succeeded in effectively banning transition care for people under 16 in the country, and immediately switched to calling for limiting adults' access.

                            "Save women's sports" – including its variants, "save girls' sports", "protect women's sports", etc. – is a transphobic trope often promoted by TERFs. Similar to the "bathroom scare", the intent of the trope is to baselessly portray trans women as a grave threat to cis women and to whip up a moral panic around the trope to harm trans women and their well-being. The trope is primarily used to ridicule all trans people, and hysterical articles about "save women's sports" are frequently illustrated with carefully selected, non-flattering pictures of masculine-looking trans women who are not very representative of trans women. Very few trans women are in fact taking any part in competitive women's sports at all, and many trans women are afraid of coming into contact with that kind of arenas. Yet this spurious trope of very limited relevance gets disproportionate attention in transphobic discourse even in mainstream media outlets. The trope conveniently ignores that many cis men and women have significant biological and other advantages compared to other people of the same cis gender.

                            "Last June, biking champion Kate Weatherly, who identifies as a trans woman, lamented the new exclusion of trans-woman-identified athletes from certain women’s sports. The rules now applied to women’s swimming would ban Weatherly from women’s biking if they were applied there as well. These comments led the hashtag #savewomenssports to trend on Twitter, showing that many people welcome new rules that keep women’s sports open only to biological females. This idea is controversial, but it shouldn’t be…

…So, if what we mean by “woman” is “adult human female,” trans women are not women. If all we mean by “woman” is “feminine,” then we should probably just say that. Regardless of how we identify trans women, they are not female athletes. We must save women’s sports, so that biological women can retain fair and competitive athletic spaces.

School choice for Republicans is a code word for segregation and allowing discrimination. It is a code word for the privatization of public schools. Rather than federal dollars going to public schools for teaching improvements or community learning, Republicans believe those dollars are better spent in the form of a voucher, which can be used toward tuition at a private or charter school.

We have heard a great deal of overblown rhetoric during the sixties in which the word "war" has perhaps too often been used--the war on poverty, the war on misery, the war on disease, the war on hunger. But if there is one area where the word "war" is appropriate it is in the fight against crime. We must declare and win the war against the criminal elements which increasingly threaten our cities, our homes, and our lives. We have a tragic example of this problem in the Nation's Capital, for whose safety the Congress and the Executive have the primary responsibility.

John Kerry came from a privileged background and could have avoided it too. Instead he said, send me.

When they sent those swift-boats up the river in Vietnam, and told them their job was to draw hostile fire—to show the American flag and bait the enemy to come out and fight—John Kerry said, send me. When it was time to heal the wounds of war and normalize relations with Vietnam—and to demand an accounting of the POWs and MIAs we lost there—John Kerry said, send me.

When we needed someone to push the cause of inner-city kids struggling to avoid a life of crime, or to bring the benefits of high technology to ordinary Americans, or to clean the environment in a way that creates jobs, or to give small businesses a better chance to make it, John Kerry said send me.

Tonight my friends, I ask you to join me for the next 100 days in telling John Kerry’s story and promoting his plans. Let every person in this hall and all across America say to him what he has always said to America: Send Me."\

                            [David Allsopp] The background: many anti-transgender people — transphobes, Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists (TERFs), “gender critical feminists”, or whatever you want to call them — have a mantra about how women’s “sex-based rights” are somehow being threatened, removed, weakened, eroded, or erased by transgender rights.

They normally upgrade the slogan to “hard-fought sex-based rights” or “hard-won sex-based rights”, for additional emphasis. Rebecca dismantles this ahistorical nonsense in her article. See also: How did public bathrooms get to be separated by sex in the first place? on the “separate spheres” ideology of the 19th Century.

Now, the fundamental point is that “sex-based rights”, by the plain English meaning of those words, cannot exist in a country that has equality law, like the UK. If your rights are equal, then they cannot be based upon your sex, by definition. The phrase flatly contradicts the central principles of our equality law — see the Equality Act 2010 statute, guidance, and particularly the statutory code of practice.

So, what do anti-trans people mean when they use this phrase? They rarely explain, because it’s mostly a dog-whistle: a rallying slogan much like “family values” for religious conservatives, which sounds wholesome but is a deniable and slippery code-word for a whole raft of unpleasant bigotry.

                            Another scary-sounding term for Muslims is Sharia law, which describes a legal system that pushes Islam in both public and private life.

To be clear, there is absolutely no chance of Sharia law going into effect anywhere in the US. Still, politicians have stoked fears about it since the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Some states, including, most recently, South Carolina, have even moved to ban Sharia law in state courtrooms. (Courts routinely consider foreign law when overseeing, for instance, the end of marriages that happened in other countries, but they don't enforce Sharia law.) There's even a website, BanShariaLaw.com, dedicated to the bans.

Fears of Sharia law play into the idea that Muslims are infiltrating the US and threatening to impose their ways on other Americans, so everyone should fear even Muslims who appear moderate. This is, once again, a way of lumping the majority of Muslims — who want nothing to do with extremism — into the same category as extreme followers of the religion.

                            His use of the word “shekels” set off a round of accusations, questions and head-scratching among political commentators, drawing a spate of media coverage. Although it is the word for the currency in Israel and an occasionally used slang term for money in the United States, it is also a common anti-Semitic trope on white-supremacist sites and in message boards threads about Jewish conspiracies, greed and supposed control of industries such as Hollywood, finance, media and publishing.

“It’s generally used sarcastically (usually with the /r/conspiracy crowd) to refer to money, often with the connotation that Jews are greedy and try to control the market,” a commenter on the site Reddit explained in a thread about the use of the term two years ago. A cursory glance at the neo-Nazi site the Daily Stormer and the Internet message board 4chan yielded a flurry of recent posts with the word, nearly all of the uses offensive.

                            Shoah ("catastrophe" or "calamity") is the Hebrew term used since the 1940s to describe the Holocaust. Alt-right website The Right Stuff has a podcast called The Daily Shoah, its name being both a play on The Daily Show and a deliberately offensive reference to the Holocaust. In alt-right circles, shoahed or shoah'd essentially means "shut down", and usually refers to the suspension of an alt-righter's social media account.

                            \
                            Nixon’s conservative populism attempted to obscure the differences between working-class and affluent voters by portraying the silent majority as both heroes and victims of this tumultuous period. In the 1968 campaign, Nixon praised the “forgotten Americans, the nonshouters, the nondemonstrators” — hard-working, tax-paying Americans whose values were under siege by antiwar protesters, urban rioters, criminals and antipoverty liberals.

In 1970, Nixon’s chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, asked the president’s political team to develop “a plan to mobilize the Silent Majority.” The White House operative Charles Colson incorporated “Silent Majority Inc.” in all 50 states and organized rallies through fake grass-roots organizations like Americans for Winning the Peace and the Honor America Committee. The administration worked on an internal “blue-collar strategy” to finesse the economic liberalism and cultural conservatism of white working-class Democrats viewed as potential Republican voters. The White House even orchestrated the formation of a National Black Silent Majority Committee to represent African-Americans being “shouted down by a handful of militants.”

Nixon was always careful to say that black Americans were part of the silent majority, but his populist agenda targeted white voters who believed that the civil rights and antiwar movements had gone too far. “Enough Is Enough,” a manifesto circulated by conservative groups in the late 1960s, spoke for the Americans who “pay taxes to provide schools for sit-ins, books for burning, rallying points for off-campus riots and study courses in anarchism.” During the 1972 campaign, Nixon invited “those millions who have been driven out of their home in the Democratic party ... to join us as members of a new American majority.”

I pledged in my campaign for the Presidency to end the war in a way that we could win the peace. I have initiated a plan of action which will enable me to keep that pledge.

The more support I can have from the American people, the sooner that pledge can be redeemed; for the more divided we are at home, the less likey, the enemy is to negotiate at Paris.

Let us be united for peace. Let us also be united against defeat. Because let us understand: North Vietnam cannot defeat or humiliate the United States. Only Americans can do that."\

                            \
                            The social construction of poor Black single mothers deemed them the agents of their own misfortune due to their unmarried status— assumed to indicate loose morals, hypersexuality, and presumed laziness— framed as reliance on public assistance rather than work. For example, stigmatizing metaphors such as the “Welfare Queen” were built on longstanding race and gender stereotypes and widely held beliefs. These perceptions persisted despite the fact that for most of the history of AFDC, these mothers were routinely restricted from accessing benefits for which they were eligible. Nevertheless, the “public identity” of the Welfare Queen, though coined and popularized in the 1980s, had already been shaped in the public imagination by the 1960s.

[Assistant Labor Secretary, Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s] 1965 report, entitled The Negro Family: The Case For National Action, argued that the basic problem for the Black population was male unemployment and the low wages Black workers received. Most people agreed with that basic premise. The Report, however, concentrated on the instability of Black family life, particularly the “proliferation of the single-parent or female-headed family and its illegitimate offspring.” Moynihan considered these to be the major causes of what he called a “tangle of pathology” that “helped to mire many Blacks in poverty.” In short, Black families’ failure to adapt to the family wage paradigm created internal conditions through its matriarchal structure that were self-replicating and intergenerational, including poor school performance, street crime, delinquency, and drug use.

                            "Perhaps the most insidious effect of welfare is its usurpation of the role of provider. In States where payments are highest, for instance, public assistance for a single mother can amount to much more than the usable income of a minimum wage job. In other words, it can pay for her to quit work. Many families are eligible for substantially higher benefits when the father is not present. What must it do to a man to know that his own children will be better off if he is never legally recognized as their father? Under existing welfare rules, a teenage girl who becomes pregnant can make herself eligible for welfare benefits that will set her up in an apartment of her own, provide medical care, and feed and clothe her. She only has to fulfill one condition—not marry or identify the father."\

                            The sonnenrad or sunwheel is one of a number of ancient European symbols appropriated by the Nazis in their attempt to invent an idealized "Aryan/Norse" heritage. The sonnenrad appears in the traditional symbology of many countries and cultures, including Old Norse and Celtic cultures. It has countless variations; the swastika and similar rounded variants are actually sonnenrad forms, as are certain versions of the Celtic Cross. In Nazi Germany, the Nazi Party, the SA and the SS all used sonnenrad symbology at times, which has led neo-Nazis and other modern white supremacists to adopt such images. One sonnenrad version in particular is popular among white supremacists: two concentric circles with crooked rays emanating from the inner circle to the outer circle. Often white supremacists will put another hate symbol such as a swastika in the center of the inner circle.Because sonnenrad imagery is used by many cultures around the world, one should not assume that most sonnenrad-like images necessarily denote racism or white supremacy; rather, they should be analyzed carefully in the context in which they appear.

                            The ad spotlights Clinton aiding and abetting the “global special interests” who “control the levers of power” and “don’t have your good in mind.” It continues, “It’s a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.”90 Accompanying each of these key phrases are images of Janet Yellen (Chair of the Federal Reserve), George Soros (investor/philanthropist), and Lloyd Blankfein (Goldman Sachs CEO)—all of whom are Jewish, and who would likely not appear otherwise. These phrases/images are all dog-whistles, steeped in the echoes of history. The notion that Jews are nomadic vampires (literally and figuratively) endlessly wandering in search of global control, puppet masters whose hands control the strings of media and finance, is archaic. These discourses have played major roles in Jewish persecution, from the time of Hellenization through to the Holocaust

                            SPQR is an abbreviation for the Latin Senātus Populusque Rōmānus, or "the Senate and People of Rome", one of the phrases associated with the Roman Republic and the Empire. It was mostly associated with the civic sphere, as it mentions, well, the Roman Senate and people. However, in the grand tradition of fascists taking things and ruining them for everyone, the alt-right has begun using the slogan and associated banners due to a misconception of its association with the Roman military, as well as its use by (who else?) Benito Mussolini.The irony of a motto traditionally used to denote a (semi-) democratic republic being used by fascists is, sadly, lost on most people.

                            A loaded question posed by Helen Staniland in early 2021 shortly before her Twitter suspension: "Do you believe that male-bodied people with a penis should have the right to undress in front of women and young girls?"

No one in the trans-rights movement has actually advocated exposing kids to naked adults. But TERFs have started routinely demanding that they answer the "Staniland Question". The question is a blatant example of the age-old demonization of LGBT people as dangerous predators. It also assumes that trans-rights supporters might not object to communal changing spaces for different reasons (e.g. privacy and body shaming).

                            Totally innocent and nonracial, right? Not so much. López says we first heard this from Barry Goldwater, who was running on a very unpopular platform critical of the New Deal, during the 1964 presidential election. "He makes the critical decision to use coded racial appeals, trying to take advantage of rising racial anxiety in the face of the civil rights movement," says López. In other words, while "states' rights" is a pretty racially neutral issue, you just have to look at what was happening at the moment to realize that everyone knew it translated to the right of states to resist federal mandates to integrate schools and society.

Terms like the “coastal elite,” “puppet masters,” “string pullers,” “banksters,” and the “octopus”—all of which have been used as antisemitic code words—are frequently trotted out. So are institutions which antisemites frequently target as the mechanisms of Jewish control, including the Federal Reserve and Trilateral Commission.

Used primarily by UK-based TERFs, it seems to have emerged in the first half of 2021, and has largely replaced the chequered flag and red square. The colour scheme is based on the historical tri-color used by the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), an organization that campaigned for women's suffrage in the United Kingdom from 1903 to 1918. This is yet another example of TERFs trying to cast themselves as the political successors of suffragettes...A variation using three heart emojis (💜🤍💚) is also sometimes used, as well as variations without the white (e.g. 🟪🟩🟪🟩). Some people use different emojis with similar colors to refer to the same thing, instead of explicitly using square or heart emojis. TERFs in North America sometimes use purple/white/yellow variants (e.g. 💜🤍💛). This is the color scheme historically used by the American suffragette movement.

                            The term “superpredator” is absolutely a racist term that was specifically deployed to stereotype and target black children in the 1990s with the intention of locking them up to protect terrified white people from “bad [black] dudes.”

John DiIulio Jr., a former aide to President George W. Bush and currently a professor of politics, religion and civil society at the University of Pennsylvania, is the man who coined the term “superpredator” in 1995. In a piece titled, “The Coming of the Super-Predator,” written in November of that year, he wrote:

"There is even some evidence that juveniles are doing homicidal violence in “wolf packs.” Indeed, a 1993 study found that juveniles committed about a third of all homicides against strangers, often murdering their victim in groups of two or more. Violent youth crime, like all serious crime, is pre-dominantly intra-racial, not interfacial. The surge in violent youth crime has been most acute among black inner-city males. While the trouble will be greatest in black inner-city neighborhoods, other places are also certain to have burgeoning youth-crime problems that will spill over into upscale central-city districts, inner-ring suburbs, and even the rural heartland."

                            You hear this in Charlottesville and read it on extreme right protesters' posters as a rallying cry or a command. The agitators claim they must "take America back from …" or "rescue society from …" but the natural follow up question would be "take back from whom?" And the answer is where the euphemisms stop and their dark truth emerges.

                            "The Goyim Know,” sometimes followed by “Shut It Down,” is a popular antisemitic meme based on conspiracy theories of manipulative Jews with plans of world domination and in control of the media, economy, and governments. Typically paired with offensive images of a stereotypical Jew talking on a phone or holding a shocked expression, this meme is widely used by white supremacists and other antisemites—on sites like 4chan and 8kun (formerly 8chan)—to mock a panicked Jew whose secret plot or manipulations have been revealed by non-Jewish people, or goyim. While “goyim” is a term used by some Jews to refer to nonJews, antisemites and white supremacists have weaponized the word to mock and accuse Jews of promoting a prejudiced support for their own clan. As it spread online, “The Goyim Know” also made its way offline through an antisemitic song parody by the same name, as well as the phrase appearing on signs during the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Other manifestations of the far-right using “Goyim” to mock Jews are the Goyim Defense League (GDL) and GoyimTV.com.

                            Whiteness has changed. It is becoming blue. The white-to-blue shift moves the axis of personal and political identity from ancestry to affiliation with law enforcement. To be “white” is now to accept and endorse the absolute necropolitical (the power to administer death) authority of police. To be “blue” is to bring together all the tangled desires and frustrations connoted by whiteness into a spatialized subjugation to police authority. The resulting form of identification is a new form of nationalism. It has flags; it demands violence; and it exults in its own presumed superiority. This shift was visibly evident in the performance of the presidential election campaign by Trump’s followers, with their trucks, flags, guns, and banners.

Since the challenge to segregation in the 1950s, policing has presented itself as a “thin blue line” against disorder — a dog-whistle connecting the Civil Rights Movement to the mobility of Black people and white fears about the loss of a permanent, racialized social hierarchy. The repeated descriptions of US cities where protests were organized against police violence as “anarchist” this summer and autumn followed that logic. Unspoken but understood is that the areas which the blue line protects are white spaces: the largely segregated regions where white people mostly live.

Their name derives from the erroneous idea that 3% of the population of able-bodied men of the 13 colonies fought against the British Empire during the American Revolution; the actual percentage was closer to 15%. Three Percenters are part of the alt-right by dint of their having provided 'security' at the 2017 Unite the Right rally.

                            By its technical definition, "thug" is supposed to refer to a violent person or a criminal. But over time, it has been used so often to refer to black people that it began to carry its own connotation — the racist idea that black people are criminals or violent.

Take, for instance, the Baltimore protests. Were all the protesters in Baltimore, who were demonstrating against Freddie Gray's death in the hands of police, rioting and looting? No, but they were broadly labeled as such, even by the mayor and the president.

In comparison, one does not see the same kind of labeling with white rioters, which media outlets like CNN have labeled as, for example, "rowdy" in past instances.

As these kinds of contrasts present themselves in media, it becomes clear that the word "thug" is used to describe not merely criminal or violent behavior, but behavior from black men in particular.

                            Saying “tough on crime” is pretty similar to saying “law and order.” Politicians who use it promise that they’ll enact policies that make the United States safer to live in. In theory, this should work for everyone – who wants to live somewhere that lets bad criminals go?

“Tough on crime” is primarily used as a code for “tough on Black and Latinx people, who are dangerous!” Tough-on-crime politicians are generally always in support of increased police presence and harsh punitive measures for “non-violent” crimes, which have historically not only put people of color in jails, but in many cases, have caused their murders at the hands of the police.

Bill Clinton’s “tough on crime” speeches during his presidential campaigns in the 1990s were used to sway white voters toward the “New Democrats.” Unlike previous Democrats, Clinton’s campaign promises leaned more to the right and included his support for things, such as supporting the death penalty and increased welfare restrictions. Clinton spoke about how it was important to crack down on “inner city” criminals in order to make the country safer. He later created policies such as the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which expanded measures that doled out harsh sentences. Among other things, it increased funding for prisons and implemented a “three strikes” mandatory life sentence policy that locked up many Black and Latinx for minor offenses.

The policies that Clinton enacted negatively impacted Black communities and played a key role in molding mass incarceration as we know it today. Civil rights lawyer and advocate Michelle Alexander explains in The New Jim Crow, “once again…a new system of racialized social control was created by exploiting the vulnerabilities and racial resentments of poor and working-class whites.” Today, Black people are incarcerated 5.1 times the rate of white people, according to a report by The Sentencing Project.

The acronym was deliberately chosen to sound like "MRA" in an attempt to draw a false equivalence between trans-rights activism and the genuinely misogynistic and anti-feminist men's rights movement.

                            Endless Breitbart articles decry the “globalist elites” and “globalism,” and in one particularly pointed statement, Bannon decries the “establishment, globalist clique.” Numerous articles target liberal financier George Soros, who is described using traditional antisemitic imagery at least twice: one article calls him the “Puppet Master,” and a Breitbart Tweet says he is “Like an octopus.” “Cultural Marxism” is a frequent target; this narrative emerged as a form of coded antisemitism where the Frankfurt School philosophers, who were largely Jewish, were accused of being the cause of all the social ills that antisemites usually blame “the Jews” for. Terms like the “coastal elite,” “puppet masters,” “string pullers,” “banksters,” and the “octopus”—all of which have been used as antisemitic code words—are frequently trotted out. So are institutions which antisemites frequently target as the mechanisms of Jewish control, including the Federal Reserve and Trilateral Commission.

                            The (((echo))) is part of the coded antisemitism that occurs online. Used by antisemites, neo-Nazis, and white nationalists, the triple parentheses are applied to Jewish names or topics to identify, mock, and harass Jews in a way that is difficult to find in search engines, yet hiding in plain sight. While it originated on an antisemitic blog, the (((echo))) went mainstream with the creation of a now-removed Chrome extension—called "Coincidence Detector"—that placed three sets of parentheses around the names of Jewish individuals, of which there were over 8,000 listed. This symbol has opened yet another avenue for Jews to be targeted with antisemitic messages and even death threats— but it’s also given some Twitter users a chance to fight back by placing parentheses around their names in an act of solidarity spearheaded by Yair Rosenberg

                            A slur for transgender people, usually trans women, used as an alternative to “tranny” that’s less likely to result in a ban on social media. It was allegedly a portmanteau of 'transgender' and 'goon', originating from Something Awful, and now common at Kiwi Farms. 'Troon' is a legitimate place name in Scotland (it's a town on the Ayrshire coast), so check context, but be wary of Scottish TERF usage, e.g. unfunny wordplay on the double-meaning.

                            "Uterus-haver" has at least two different meanings:

A term used by TERFs on social media to suggest that trans women are not women because they don't have a uterus.[78] Bafflingly, this term also suggests that cis women who have had a hysterectomy are not women either.

Alternately, the term can be used to claim that trans women are really sexist men who want to steal the word "woman" for themselves, and re-brand cis women as "uterus-havers" or other terms that reduce them to their reproductive organs.

Variants of the term such as "vagina haver" and "front holer" also exist.

These tropes frequently appear when there are laws dealing with non-medical exemptions from vaccines, as these people fear government takeover and forcing children to vaccinate and giving them autism just as how the Jews are persecuted during the Holocaust.

                            "Voter fraud" is often used by Republicans to refer to minority voters, who predominately vote Democratic, to give justification for laws that make it harder for those voters to vote. Since actual voter fraud is incredibly rare in the United States (less than one-one thousandth of one percent of all votes cast, and most of it actually favors Republicans), it's rather obvious what this term really means when a Republican uses it.

                            Many of Trump's Christian supporters argue that the president is ending the so-called war on Christmas, which has been presented by evangelicals and Fox news anchors as a threat to America's Christian culture. Trump supporters say Americans have become too politically correct when they wish people happy holidays, a neutral term that can be used for people who celebrate Hanukkah, Eid al-Adha or any other religious holiday that takes place around the same time as Christmas. But critics counter that Trump is promoting a version of the holidays that excludes members of other religions, and that his crusade to bring back Christmas is part of a larger attempt by the president to define America as a country for white Christians alone.

"I see such invocations of Christmas as a kind of cypher, what some would call a dog whistle. It does not appear to be intolerant or extreme, but to attentive audiences it speaks volumes about identity and belonging—who and what are fully American," Richard King, a professor at Washington State University who studies how white supremacists exploit culture, told Newsweek.

                            Clinton also seemed to be listening to Thomas and Mary Edsall, whose book Chain Reaction came out in 1991. As the authors of the most comprehensive critique of the Southern strategy to date, the Edsalls regarded further racial backlash as virtually inevitable unless the Democrats distanced themselves from African Americans and recalibrated their politics to endorse limiting welfare and ratcheting up the war on crime…Clinton’s pandering to dog whistle sensibilities extended well beyond the campaign trail. As president he endorsed a federal Three Strikes law dramatically expanding the nation’s incarcerated population; he funneled a further $30 billion into Reagan’s “war on crime”; and he vastly increased the number of federal offenses subject to capital punishment…

Many states still have on the books laws of convict leasing that strip convicted felons of the right to vote. Far from becoming outdated and ineffective in reducing nonwhite voting power, the modern war on crime dramatically increased the disempowering impact of such laws. A 2008 report from the Brennan Center for Justice warned that because of felon disenfranchisement laws, “three in ten of the next generation of African-American men can expect to lose the right to vote at some point in their lifetime”.

                            "Now, I'd like to turn to another subject: the war on drugs. I want all Americans to take heart. This war is not yet won, not by a long shot. But we're doing better, and our nation is united against this scourge as never before.

Right now there's a drug bill on Capitol Hill. It has passed the House but hasn't even come up for consideration in the Senate, and time is fast running out. The House bill has many good and tough provisions that express our national commitment to five simple but powerful words. Those words are "zero tolerance" and "just say no."

When we say zero tolerance, we mean, simply, that we've had it. We will no longer tolerate those who sell drugs and those who buy drugs. All Americans of good will are determined to stamp out those parasites who survive and even prosper by feeding off the energy and vitality and humanity of others. They must pay. We believe that when those who sell drugs are caught they must make redress for the damage they cause."\

                            This phrase evokes an image of the US military (and the nation) banding together to fight against all evils that threaten our liberty and justice. And who wouldn’t want to fight terror and defend our freedom? What isn’t explicit is that the “terror” that many politicians want us to go to war against are actually people of Arab and Muslim descent, who “for no reason at all,” hate everything the US stands for (like freedom and women’s rights).

Proponents of fighting the “war on terror” often push for more military funding, invasions into other countries, and stricter immigration laws – all in the name of keeping (white) Americans safe from evil Arab and Muslim people. 

Immediately after 9/11, George W. Bush declared we would be going to war with all terrorists capable of harming the US, and created a large-scale military campaign in order to do so. In particular, Bush cited North Korea, Iraq, and Iran as countries that were hiding weapons of mass destruction and that actively trampled on their citizen’s rights. In his 2002 State of the Union address, he said these nations “constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world.” This also led to nationwide acts of racism, xenophobia, and Islamophobia against all people coded as Muslim and Arab. According to the FBI, hate crimes against Muslim people or people believed to be Muslim went up 1600% after 9/11.

Muslims, Sikhs, Arabs, South Asians, and people perceived to be members of these groups in the United States have been continuously stereotyped as anti-American terrorists and have been brutalized and forced to apologize for it. Two Indian men, for instance, were shot in a Kansas bar in February by a white man who yelled, “Get out of my country!” The suspect gloated that he killed two Iranian men. Last year, a new study released by California State University, San Bernardino found that hate crimes against Muslims were up 78% in 2015. In addition to domestic hate crimes, the US continues to bomb countless Muslim-majority countries while simultaneously banning Muslim refugees from entering, all in the name of “keeping America safe.”

                            "War on women" is a slogan in United States politics used to describe certain Republican Party policies and legislation as a wide-scale effort to restrict women's rights, especially reproductive rights, including abortion. Prominent Democrats such as Nancy Pelosi and Barbara Boxer, as well as feminists, have used the phrase to criticize proponents of these laws as trying to force their social views on women through legislation.The slogan has been used to describe Republican policies in areas such as access to reproductive health services, particularly birth control and abortion services; the definition of rape for the purpose of the public funding of abortion; the prosecution of criminal violence against women; and workplace discrimination against women.

While used in other contexts, and prior to 2010, it became a common slogan in American political discourse after the 2010 congressional elections. The term is often used to describe opposition to the contraceptive mandate in Obamacare and policies to defund women's health organizations that perform abortions, such as Planned Parenthood. The concept again gained attention in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, when Republican nominee Donald Trump drew notice for a history of inflammatory statements and actions toward women.

The phrase and the concept have been criticized by Republicans and some anti-abortion Democrats. Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus described it as an over-simplified fiction advanced by Democrats and the media while other Republicans contended that such rhetoric was used as a distraction from President Barack Obama and the Democrats' handling of the economy. In August 2012, Todd Akin's controversial comments regarding pregnancy and rape sparked renewed media focus on the concept. Republicans have tried to turn the phrase against Democrats by using it to argue hypocrisy for not critiquing sex scandals of members within their party who have cheated, sexted, and harassed women, and for not supporting bills to combat sex-selective abortion.

RESEARCH NOTE: "war on women" may also be a transphobic dog whistle, with the covert meaning of trans people threatening the livelihoods of cis women. As with all dogwhistles, context is especially important.

                            When Lyndon Johnson declared his War on Poverty, he extended the benefits of social welfare to nonwhites. In the process, this effort targeted segregation, for obviously poverty in nonwhite communities was deeply tied to racially closed workplaces, schools, and housing. As a result, welfare and integration became tightly linked, and hostility toward integration morphed into opposition to welfare. “The positive liberties [that the War on Poverty] extended to African Americans, notes Jill Quadagno, a scholar of race and welfare, “were viewed by the working class as infringement on their negative liberties, the liberty for trade unions to discriminate in the selection of apprentices and to control job training programs; the liberty to exclude minorities from representation in local politics; the liberty to maintain segregated neighborhoods”. To talk of rank racial discrimination in unions, politics, and housing in the language of a perceived infringement on liberty may seem strange. Yet for many, this is how they experienced integration. It was a social experiment being forced on them by government, and therefore a governmental infringement on their liberty to exclude. Reagan’s campaign against welfare helped make the case for tax cuts by successfully using social programs like welfare, and its implicit connection to integration, to convince voters that the real danger in their lives came from a looming, intrusive, government.

                            Martin Gilens’s research reveals that, even today, the American public holds two prevalent beliefs about welfare. First, that most people who receive welfare are Black, and second, that Blacks are less dedicated to working than other Americans. Hearing the tale of the Welfare Queen and believing that the government was privileging non-deserving loafers over hardworking people like them, would comport with many Americans’ racial perceptions and, therefore, be cognitively plausible. The advantage of using metaphors is that it taps into an accepted communal system of values. By implying that committing acts of fraud was part of the character of the Welfare Queen trope, Reagan reinforced the “undeserving” status of the recipient. Reagan, casting this story as truth, confirmed many White Americans’ common sense of outrage over the deterioration of their country. As critical race scholar Richard Delgado notes, “[t]he stories or narratives told by the ingroup remind it of its identity in relation to outgroups, and provide it with a form of shared reality in which its own superior position is seen as natural.” Moreover, by 1976, the ongoing assault on welfare recipients coincided with a period of high inflation, falling wages, post-Vietnam War humiliation, and civil-rights weariness. The Welfare Queen trope triggered an emotional response in a body politic already anxious, seething with resentment, and primed to create a scapegoat: a welfare cheat who was perceived to be living a lavish lifestyle at taxpayer expense. Reagan continued to symbolically deploy his polarizing approach throughout the primary season. He was not reticent to exploit Americans’ racial fears, doing so consistently, selectively, and with language culturally resonant to each group of listeners.

                            It’s used to imply that Black women on social programs like welfare are lazy people who don’t do anything to “help themselves.” Instead, they have children to use up government money and the tax dollars of “hard-working” (read: white) Americans to live luxuriously.

Ronald Reagan first hinted at this stereotype in 1976, while he was campaigning and promoting his anti-government assistance stance. In Reagan’s speeches, he never explicitly used the term “Black” or “African-American.” Instead, he drew upon stereotypes of Black people, such as the “over sexualized woman” and the “violent big, Black buck” tropes, to draw the connection between race and criminality. These speeches implied that Black people were criminals who refused to work. Instead, they tricked the government by abusing welfare systems to buy themselves extravagant things. One of his speeches in particular spoke about how frustrating it was to buy a hamburger at the grocery store, when someone on welfare could buy a T-bone steak.

Because of this rhetoric, an increasing amount of restrictions are placed on public assistance programs, many of which make it even more impossible for people to pull themselves out of poverty. This is an issue because, as the Census Bureau data has proven, welfare programs are extremely effective. These programs aren’t a burden on society, but rather ways to help people and stimulate the economy.

These types of stereotypes about Black people “living off the government” still exist today and Black people are still demonized for needing public assistanc. For instance, back in 2012, then-GOP candidate Rick Santorum stated he was against welfare because he didn’t “want to make Black people’s lives better by giving them somebody else’s money.” In 2015, Gene Alday, a Republican politician from Mississippi, claimed that “all the blacks are getting food stamps and what I call ‘welfare crazy checks…They don’t work.”

Research Note: Politicians have rarely used the actual term "welfare queen", but frequently invoke this portrayal (which Reagan popularized) as a racial dogwhistle. The media coverage of Linda Taylor (the "woman in Chicago") were primarily responsible for popularizing the term [https://newrepublic.com/article/154404/myth-welfare-queen, https://www.nytimes.com/1976/02/15/archives/welfare-queen-becomes-issue-in-reagan-campaign-hitting-a-nerve-now.html ], with the term probably originating from the Chicago Tribune's reporting on Linda Taylor's welfare fraud trials in Fall 1974.

                            Many voters may not detect the subtle politics of race at work here, but it speaks clearly to the subsection of the public that equates redistribution with handouts to poor minorities… 

This reading is backed up by political science. As Martin Gilens notes in his 1999 book, Why Americans Hate Welfare: Race, Media, and the Politics of Antipoverty Policy, there is a strong correlation between views on race and opposition to welfare. "Most white Americans believe that blacks are less committed to the work ethic than are whites, and this belief is strongly related to opposition to welfare," Gilens writes. This association began in the mid-1960s, when, Gilens notes, the ratio of African-Americans in photos attached to articles about poverty jumped drastically. Until then, Americans largely associated poverty with Appalachia, but as depictions of poverty changed, so did stereotypes. "Despite the fact that African Americans constitute only 36 percent of welfare recipients and only 27 percent of poor Americans, whites' attitudes toward poverty and welfare are dominated by their beliefs about blacks," Gilens says…

Romney's motivation for racially motivated attacks is fairly simple. As Ruy Teixeira explains at The New Republic, the fate of his campaign hinges in part on his vote share among working-class whites. Obama lost this group by 18 percent in 2008, but they turned on Democrats by 30 points in 2010, handing Republicans control of the House. If Obama gets around 38 percent of the white vote in 2012, he should hold his spot in the White House. Romney isn't quite reaching an adequate level of support among those voters. White seniors are the other demographic Romney needs to win by a wide margin in November, a group also primed to be receptive to this rhetorical shift. To appeal to these voters and counter Obama's narrative that the economy is in the doldrums thanks to Wall Street profiteering, Romney has turned to the politics of downward resentment.

The Romney campaign's characterization of Obama completes the picture-it portrays the president as an angry black man who is exacting racial revenge on whites by giving undeserving minorities your money. It plays straight into a stereotype of black men, an image Obama has distanced himself from.

The stunt was a clear affront to Black Lives Matter, which has been measured as the largest racial justice movement in history. Black models walked the runway wearing the same slogan. ‘All lives Matter’ and ‘White Lives Matter’ have long served as violent retorts to the Black Lives Matter movement, used by white supremacists and hate groups, including the Ku Klux Klan.

Kanye West and Candace Owens sent a performative dog whistle to millions. Kanye knows very well that ‘white lives’ have never been targeted for oppression. Black folks, in contrast, are at the bottom of virtually every economic, social, and political measure because of centuries of individual and institutional racism. Building a world of Black freedom means upending systems that harm and building new systems of care. Ultimately this benefits everyone. When Black people get free, everybody gets free.

                            "Who nose?" is stated when the speaker wants to indicate "clearly the person who did this objectionable thing is Jewish." It's based on the pun of the legitimate question "Who knows?" and the stereotype that Jewish people have large noses. So for example if an artist named Hannah Greenbaum produces a comic book featuring a lesbian couple, an alt-righter might quip "Why would Greenbaum do that?", setting up another to reply, "Who nose?"

                            George H.W. Bush, the one-term president who died on Friday at age 94, is often overlooked by history, despite having presided over the last truly bipartisan “grand bargain” and the end of the Cold War. But if there’s one context in which his name, along with that of another man, is regularly invoked, it’s when political campaigns make coded racist appeals to white voters.

Even as President Donald Trump usurps him with increasingly transparent racist attacks, George Bush Sr.’s “Willie Horton” ad remains the key reference point for dog-whistle politics.

The infamous “Willie Horton ad” was a 1988 presidential campaign TV spot created by Bush’s supporters that attacked his Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis for being soft on crime. Dukakis, the then-governor of Massachusetts, supported his state’s “weekend pass” program, which allowed imprisoned individuals — including those not eligible for parole — to leave prison for a day or more to work or go home. (As the Washington Post noted at the time, it was introduced by a Republican governor, and most states had the same policy, including California under Ronald Reagan.)

The spot featured convicted murderer William “Willie” Horton, who had been able to escape while on such weekend furlough, and went on to rape a woman and stab her fiancé in a brutal 1987 home invasion. It was widely condemned for playing on racial fears by featuring a black man’s mug shot and linking blackness with depravity.

The ad was intended to drive scared white people to the polls to vote for tough-on-crime Bush, seeking protection from black criminals like Horton and black-friendly candidates like Dukakis. As political-science professor Claire Jean Kim said in a 2012 PBS special, “the insinuation is, if you elect Gov. Dukakis as president, we’re going to have black rapists running amok in the country.”

                            A hashtag that first emerged among Scottish TERFs before spreading throughout the UK and beyond. "Wheesht" is Scottish slang meaning "shush" or "be quiet." The hashtag was started after a Scottish TERF was charged with malicious communications for tweeting about about how she'd left a suffragette ribbon (interpreted by many as a noose due to the poor quality of the photo) near a Glasgow television studio where an actor known to support trans rights works. In one particularly hilarious example, TERF author Jessica Taylor tweeted pictures of how she allegedly "found" this hashtag scrawled in the sand on a beach during a morning walk with a stick in her hand.

                            Alternative spellings of "woman"/"women" used to avoid ending the word with "-man". Historically, these terms have been used in wider feminist discourse. However, they are now used mostly by TERFs (since the 2010s). The term "wombyn" deliberately puts more emphasis on the uterus (primary organ involved in pregnancy); it is purposefully trans-exclusionary and used by TERFs since trans women are unable to become pregnant even post-transition.

                            For some, the phrase "wonder-working power" had no particular meaning, but for those who had been exposed to a popular evangelical hymn recognized the line as a refrain in "There is Power in the Blood"...David Kuo, who worked for various prominent Republicans and served in the George W. Bush administration, wrote "we threw in a few obscure turns of phrase known clearly to any evangelical, yet unlikely to be noticed by anyone else". Multivocal communication sugch as this might be particularly effective because it targets those predisposed to respond favorably to the message and goes over the heads of those who may be turned off by it

                            This term is harmful in the way it excludes [Black families]. The image of “working class” families is one that is largely coded as “white” within the public imagination, frequently associated with rural, suburban and exurban communities. Rather than eliminating the use of this term, it is important to continue to expand its meaning, and the range of people whose image it evokes. One way to do that is to explicitly insert Black people into the narrative it carries, for instance, by talking about Black, white and other working class communities, or by talking about Black, white and other working families.

The insult derives from a 4chan copypasta that became popular on other right wing platforms.[455] The copypasta argues that trans women are not women in a biological sense because they have no eggs and no womb and that they can never give birth, while also arguing that any compliments given to them are fake and humiliating in order to imply that trans women will mutilate their body to fish for likes.

                            Sharp criticism of Israel, even criticism that pushes the limits of civility, is not necessarily anti-Semitic. However, anti-Semitic tweets will often employ the term “Zionist” as a stand-in for “Jew,” in a context that clearly indicates the tweet was either motivated by anti-Semitism or perpetuated anti-Semitic themes.

                            White supremacist belief declaring the U.S. government is controlled by Jews. ZOG is a white supremacist theory that believes Jews (“Zionists”) secretly control Western politics (see conspiracy theory, control). The term first appeared in the 1970s in the U.S. and is found on white supremacist sites such as Aryan Nations and National Alliance. By manipulating Western governments, antisemites claim ZOG controls the world economy, limits free speech, confiscates land, and usurps military and police forces. The phrase “Zionist occupiers” is also used by antisemites on the far-left and by Islamists, seeking to destroy Israel.

Nazis usually conflate these locations with 'countries'. One may also see a 110, meaning that Jews need to be kicked out from another country.

                            13%, 13/50, or 13/52 is a racist dogwhistle for African American people, in reference to the supposed statistic that "despite being only 13% of the population, African Americans commit approximately 50% of homicides in the USA" or "despite making up only 13% of the population, African Americans make up 52% of all homicides in the United States". Similarly, 13/90 refers to a related claim that 90% of all violent interracial crimes in the U.S. are committed by Blacks against Whites. Never mind that these figures are decades old, and that based on numbers arrested, African Americans have gone from committing 49.3% (56,909/115,495) of all violent crimes in 1995 to 37% (172,980/470,890) of violent crimes in 2019, showing that this meme is out-dated and currently should be "13/37". Since these statistics are based on arrests, not convictions, they are subject to bias from racial profiling. One study estimated that as much as 16-33% of arrests of racial minorities could be due to racial profiling in areas that have not had police reform.

                            1488 or 14/88 is a reference to two racist concepts, the Fourteen Words created by white supremacist David Lane ("We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children," or more rarely "Because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish from the earth") and 88 (Which originally referenced Lane's "88 Precepts" but now represents two H's (8th letter of the alphabet) to make "HH", for Heil Hitler.) It is claimed that the 14 words were inspired by a specific sentence from Volume 1, Chapter 8 of Mein Kampf which is exactly 88 words in length, though neither Lane nor his publisher Fourteen Word Press ever claimed this and it is probably a coincidence.
