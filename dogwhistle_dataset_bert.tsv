 Over the last three years women‚Äôs reproductive rights have come under attack in a way we haven‚Äôt seen in modern history. From Louisiana to Missouri to Texas Republican legislatures are waging a war on women war on women's rights all women and they‚Äôre taking away fundamental rights. 	1

_](  These strikes were conducted in the exercise of our right of self-defense under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. This necessary and appropriate action was a pre-emptive strike directed against the Libyan terrorist infrastructure and designed to deter acts of terrorism by Libya such as the Libyan-ordered bombing of a discotheque in West Berlin on April 5. Libya's cowardly and murderous act resulted in the death of two innocent people‚Äîan American soldier and a young Turkish woman‚Äîand the wounding of 50 United States Armed Forces personnel and 180 other innocent persons.  	1
 And you look across the board at things like the fact that you know we have the dissolution of the family in so many respects. We have fatherless children children on the rise in America. We have the loss of religion in so many aspects of our country where it was a foundation of our country at one time. You can't discount the rise of social media and the role that that has played in things like this. 	1
 So it‚Äôs #genderwoowoo day and I‚Äôd like to share Kylie who pretended to be pregnant then pretended to have a stillbirth. Then tried to raise money for a doll to help him grieve. He was in a pg & birth group where women supported him & some were thrown out for telling the truth. 	1

 Studies show that more than 90% of Americans support mandatory labeling of genetically engineered (GE) foods. Yet for twenty years we have been denied that right. While our reasons for wanting to know what‚Äôs in our food may vary what unifies us is the belief that it‚Äôs our right to know. Without labeling of GE foods we cannot make informed choices about our food. The Just Label It campaign was created to advocate for the labeling of GE foods. 	1
 I think Jewish people that vote for a Democrat ‚Äî I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty. 	1
 I think implicit biases is a problem for everyone not just police. I think unfortunately too many of us in our great country um jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about you know Why am I feeling this way? But when it comes to policing since it can have literally fatal consequences I have said in my first budget we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit biases by retraining a lot of our police officers. I‚Äôve met with a group of very distinguished experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it‚Äôs an issue. They‚Äôve got a lot of concerns. 	1

 Dear @eddieizzard it's perfectly fine to be a transvestite who likes to wear women's clothing in fact we all thought you brave for doing so publicly and applauded you for it! What is NOT all right is claiming that this makes you an actual woman. It doesn't. It's #WomanFace 	1

 A reminder as to why I have never described myself as 'gender critical' (so please don't put that label on me...) Why? As an example I am a secularist and say I don't believe in God. I would not say I am 'God critical'. I am a gender abolitionist. I don't believe in it 	1

 This spring I will send you a comprehensive welfare reform bill that builds on the Family Support Act of 1988 and restores the basic values of work and responsibility. We'll say to teenagers If you have a child out of wedlock we will no longer give you a check to set up a separate household. We want families to stay together; say to absent parents who aren't paying their child support If you're not providing for your children we'll garnish your wages suspend your license track you across State lines and if necessary make some of you work off what you owe. People who bring children into this world cannot and must not walk away from them. But to all those who depend on welfare we should offer ultimately a simple compact. We'll provide the support the job training the child care you need for up to 2 years. But after that anyone who can work must in the private sector wherever possible in community service if necessary. That's the only way we'll ever make welfare what it ought to be a second chance not a way of life. 	1
 And we‚Äôre going to work on our g-ghettoss are so‚ÄìThe‚Äì you take a look at what‚Äôs going on whether you have pockets of areas of land where you have the inner cities and you have so many things so many problems. So many horrible horrible problems...The violence. The death. The lack of education. No jobs. We‚Äôre going to work with the African-American community and we‚Äôre going to solve the problem of the inner city. 	1
 And here‚Äôs the thing: when you look at what‚Äôs happened at the border we focus on the criminal aliens drugs all that‚Äôs very important. But just the sheer number of people overwhelms communities. And this idea of mass immigration whether it‚Äôs illegal immigration or whether it‚Äôs just mass immigration through the legal process like the diversity lottery or chain migration is not conducive to assimilating people into American society. 	1
 If you visit a restaurant bar etc and you hated the gender neutral or ‚Äòtrans inclusive‚Äô toilets - ie ‚Äòmixed-sex‚Äô - write a review on TripAdvisor saying so. If the mixed-sex loos put you off visiting again add that too. Only way to get some people to listen is a negative review 	1

When it was not politically correct Governor Romney stood up for life required English in the classroom and fought for marriage as between a man and a woman. Governor Romney believes that we can strengthen America by bringing pro-family conservative change to Washington. 	1

 Political parties seeking to appease the loudest voices in this debate are ignoring women‚Äôs concerns at their peril. In the UK women are reaching out to each other across party lines concerned about the erosion of their hard-won rights and widespread intimidation. None of the #gendercrit women I‚Äôve talked to hates trans people; on the contrary. Many of them became interested in this issue in the first place out of concern for trans youth and they‚Äôre hugely sympathetic towards trans adults who simply want to live their lives but who‚Äôre facing a backlash for a brand of activism they don‚Äôt endorse. 	1

 You see the rot at the core of the system‚Äôs embracing of the neofascist wing of the ruling class which is Donald Trump and company. And the neoliberals wing of the ruling class which is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. The reason some of us argue against Trump in the form of a vote for a milquetoast mediocre centrist Biden ‚Äî who‚Äôs head of a rotten Democratic establishment ‚Äî is because we‚Äôre trying to stop the American march toward fascism. So that was part of the anti-fascist coalition.	1
 The bill that liberals inaccurately call Don't Say Gay would be more accurately described as an Anti-Grooming bill. If you're against the Anti-Grooming Bill you are probably a groomer or at least you don't denounce the grooming of 4-8 year old children. Silence is complicity. This is how it works Democrats and I didn't make the rules 	1

 That is not a protest. That is not a statement. It‚Äôs people -- a handful of people taking advantage of a situation for their own purposes and they need to be treated as criminals...My understanding is is you‚Äôve got some of the same organizers now going back into these communities to try to clean up in the aftermath of a handful of criminals and thugs who tore up the place. What they were doing what those community leaders and clergy and others were doing that is a statement. That‚Äôs the kind of organizing that needs to take place if we‚Äôre going to tackle this problem. 	1

 This week we have twice seen Supreme Court Justices violating their judicial oaths. Yesterday the Justices re-wrote Obamacare yet again in order to force this failed law on the American people. Today the Court doubled down with a 5-4 opinion that undermines not just the definition of marriage but the very foundations of our representative form of government. Both decisions were judicial activism plain and simple. Both were lawless...	1
 I'm with you 100%. The ONLY good thing I see to come out of this is that this is the biggest red-pill to normie MAGAS we could ever administer this is a nuclear blast. We no longer have our guy in there and the fraud is naked before us all. 	1

 Get out and vote. But they even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths where so many cities are corrupt. And you see that. And voting fraud is all too common. And then they criticize us for saying that. And we have even Republicans Oh that's such a terrible thing to say.	1

 Do you support the cancel culture? The cosmopolitan elites of Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden who blame America first? Do you think America is to blame? Or do you believe in American greatness? Believe in yourself? In President Trump? In individual and personal responsibility? They want to destroy this country and everything that we have fought for and hold dear. They want to steal your liberty your freedom. They want to control what you see and think and believe so that they can control how you live. They want to enslave you to the weak dependent liberal victim ideology to the point that you will not recognize this country or yourself 	1

 What we don‚Äôt do is teach our children to view everything through a lens of race where we divide them into buckets ‚Äì one group‚Äôs an oppressor and another group‚Äôs a victim ‚Äì and we pit them against each other and we steal their dreams. We will not be a commonwealth of dream-stealers. We will be a commonwealth of dream-enablers and builders. We know it's not right. We're all created equal and we're trying so hard to live up to those immortal words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who implored us to be better than we are; to judge one another based on the content of our character and not the color of our skin. And so let me be clear on day one we will not have political agendas in the classroom and I will ban CRT.  	1

 Quality has declined as federal intervention has increased. Nothing has created more bitterness for example than forced bussing to achieve racial balance. It was born of a hope that we could increase understanding and reduce prejudice and antagonism. And Im sure we all approved of that goal. But busing has failed to achieve the goal. Instead it has increased the bitterness and animosity it was supposed to reduce. Californias Superintendent of Public Instruction Wilson Riles (himself a Black) says The concept that Black children cant learn unless they are sitting with white children is utter and complete nonsense. Well I agree. The money now being wasted on this social experiment could be better spent to provide the kind of school facilities every child deserves. Forced busing should be ended by legislation if possible by constitutional amendment if necessary. And control of education should be returned to local school districts. 	1
 I wrote an op-ed in the New York Times. It had a very simple message very simple common sense message grounded in American history and law supported by a majority of Americans arguing very simply if the police cannot or especially if they are not allowed to restore order then it is time to send in the troops. And what happened next? Total meltdown with the little social justice warriors at the New York Times. All these children that have been marinated in the language of the campus seminar room. They said things like ‚ÄúYour words put my life at risk‚Äù as if typing on their phone sitting on their futons was as dangerous as being a cop trying to stop rioters in the streets. Or ‚ÄúYour words are violence.‚Äù Now I‚Äôm sorry Kiddo. Words are words. Violence is what your friends are doing out on the streets of America. 	1

 One thing I do agree with the Kalergi Plan is I think it's real. I think that there are people who think evilly who actually think that they want to get rid of white people. Why do I say that?

 In the future if we get indexing planted firmly as a law of the land the advocates of big government who want money more money for their social spending their social engineering schemes will have to go to the people and say right out loud: We want more money from your weekly paycheck so we're raising your taxes. Do that instead of sneaking it out by way of inflation which they have helped bring on. 	1
 I fiercely supported President Donald Trump during his bid for re-election. I stood with the President in Duluth Bemidji Mankato and the Twin Cities because like me he understands and fights for our way of life.

 Now George Meany he wants the right-to-work law repealed in Texas in my state. Senator Mondale's for the repeal of right-to-work laws. He wants to force you to join a labor union. Seventy-five percent of America's working men and women don't belong to labor unions but they will if George Meany and Governor Carter and Senator Mondale have their way. They've also got some big Proposition Fourteen out in California where organizers come on your property three hours a day and organize farmers unionize farmers. Governor Carter's for that.

 Recently advocates of alarmism have grown increasingly desperate to try to convince the public that global warming is the greatest moral issue of our generation. Just last week the vice president of London's Royal Society sent a chilling letter to the media encouraging them to stifle the voices of scientists skeptical of climate alarmism. During the past year the American people have been served up an unprecedented parade of environmental alarmism by the media and entertainment industry which link every possible weather event to global warming. The year 2006 saw many major organs of the media dismiss any pretense of balance and objectivity on climate change coverage and instead crossed squarely into global warming advocacy.	1

 Half of all the liberal students say it's OK to infringe upon the free speech rights of other students because they offend others. Apparently they offend anybody except for conservatives.

 Now of course we have to recognize all balanced budgets aren't created equal. The crucial question is how do we balance the budget? I don't think you want us to balance the budget by weaseling out of the first decent tax program since John Kennedy's tax cut nearly 20 years ago. Nor would you have us do it by compromising defenses and placing our country's security in peril. There is a better way. Balance the budget by bringing to heel a Federal establishment which has taken too much power from the States too much liberty with the Constitution and too much money from the people. 	1

 Quality has declined as federal intervention has increased. Nothing has created more bitterness for example than mandatory bussing to achieve racial balance. It was born of a hope that we could increase understanding and reduce prejudice and antagonism. And Im sure we all approved of that goal. But busing has failed to achieve the goal. Instead it has increased the bitterness and animosity it was supposed to reduce. Californias Superintendent of Public Instruction Wilson Riles (himself a Black) says The concept that Black children cant learn unless they are sitting with white children is utter and complete nonsense. Well I agree. The money now being wasted on this social experiment could be better spent to provide the kind of school facilities every child deserves. Forced busing should be ended by legislation if possible by constitutional amendment if necessary. And control of education should be returned to local school districts. 	1

 As modern life brings changes in our society it also puts stresses on families trying to adjust to new realities while maintaining cherished values. Economic uncertainty unemployment housing difficulties women's and men's concerns with their changing and often conflicting roles high divorce rates threatened neighborhoods and schools and public scandal all create a hostile atmosphere that erodes family structures and family values. Thus it is imperative that our government's programs actions officials and social welfare institutions never be allowed to jeopardize the family. We fear the government may be powerful enough to destroy our families; we know that it is not powerful enough to replace them. 	1

I know that my answers to those questions are very different than those of the current President of the United States...He pushed through ObamaCare an entitlement program we didn‚Äôt want and can‚Äôt afford. He‚Äôs refused to advance a responsible plan to strengthen existing entitlements.  	1

 Quality has declined as federal intervention has increased. Nothing has created more bitterness for example than forced busing to achieve racial balance. It was born of a hope that we could increase understanding and reduce prejudice and antagonism. And Im sure we all approved of that goal. But busing has failed to achieve the goal. Instead it has increased the bitterness and animosity it was supposed to reduce. Californias Superintendent of Public Instruction Wilson Riles (himself a Black) says The concept that Black children cant learn unless they are sitting with white children is utter and complete nonsense. Well I agree. The money now being wasted on this social experiment could be better spent to provide the kind of school facilities every child deserves. Forced busing should be ended by legislation if possible by constitutional amendment if necessary. And control of education should be returned to local school districts. 	1
 I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone not just police. I think unfortunately too many of us in our great country um jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about you know Why am I feeling this way?

I‚Äôve met with a group of very distinguished experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it‚Äôs an issue. They‚Äôve got a lot of concerns. 	1

 I want 100000 more police officers for community policing. The House voted for 50000 but that's not enough. As we've seen in cities from Los Angeles to Houston putting more officers on the street working with people in their communities prevents crime and lowers the crime rate. I want the House to join the Senate to ban the weapons of war that plague our streets: assault weapons. I want both Houses to tailor a provision to put away repeat violent offenders and put them away for good three strikes and they're out. 	1
 Perhaps the most insidious effect of welfare is its usurpation of the role of provider. In States where payments are highest for instance public assistance for a single mother can amount to much more than the usable income of a minimum wage job. In other words it can pay for her to quit work. Many families are eligible for substantially higher benefits when the father is not present. What must it do to a man to know that his own children will be better off if he is never legally recognized as their father? Under existing welfare rules a teenage girl who becomes pregnant can make herself eligible for welfare benefits that will set her up in an apartment of her own provide medical care and feed and clothe her. She only has to fulfill one condition‚Äînot marry or identify the father. 	1

It increasingly enables men who consider that they have a female ‚Äògender identity‚Äô to claim access to female single sex victim support services and spaces as both service users and as service providers. This includes specialist single-sex provisions for women and girls who have been subject to violence such as shelters and health care facilities. It also includes other services in which single-sex provision is crucial to the promotion of the physical safety health privacy and dignity of women and girls. The presence of men in female single-sex spaces and services undermines the role of these services in protecting women and girls and could make women and girls vulnerable to violent men who may claim a female ‚Äògender identity‚Äô. 	1

 You see the rot at the core of the system‚Äôs embracing of the neofascist wing of the ruling class which is Donald Trump and company.

The reason some of us argue against Trump in the form of a vote for a milquetoast mediocre centrist Biden ‚Äî who‚Äôs head of a rotten Democratic establishment ‚Äî is because we‚Äôre trying to stop the American march toward fascism. So that was part of the anti-fascist coalition.	1

 Recently advocates of climate alarmism have grown increasingly desperate to try to convince the public that global warming is the greatest moral issue of our generation. Just last week the vice president of London's Royal Society sent a chilling letter to the media encouraging them to stifle the voices of scientists skeptical of climate climate alarmism. During the past year the American people have been served up an unprecedented parade of environmental climate alarmism by the media and entertainment industry which link every possible weather event to global warming. The year 2006 saw many major organs of the media dismiss any pretense of balance and objectivity on climate change coverage and instead crossed squarely into global warming advocacy.	1

 The basic principles of those laws haven't been changed in over half a century making them divorced from the needs of our economy while also depressing working-class wages.

 Political parties seeking to appease the loudest voices in this debate are ignoring women‚Äôs concerns at their peril. In the UK women are reaching out to each other across party lines concerned about the erosion of their hard-won rights and widespread intimidation.

Many of them became interested in this issue in the first place out of concern for trans youth and they‚Äôre hugely sympathetic towards trans adults who simply want to live their lives but who‚Äôre facing a backlash for a brand of activism they don‚Äôt endorse. 	1

 I think raising taxes on small businesses would be a mistake. It would hurt our economy. I'm running against a fellow who's promised $2.2 trillion in new Federal spending so far and we haven't even got to the stretch run yet. So they said How are you going to pay for it? He said Oh that's simple. We'll just tax the rich. You run up the top two brackets of the individual income taxes you're taxing about a million small businesses here in America. Seventy percent of new jobs in America are created by small businesses and you're taxing the job creators. 	1

We endorse the First Amendment Defense Act Republican legislation in the House and Senate which will bar government discrimination against individuals and businesses for acting on the belief that marriage is the union of one man and one woman. This Act would protect the non-profit tax status of faith-based adoption agencies the accreditation of religious educational institutions the grants and contracts of faith-based charities and small businesses and the licensing of religious professions ‚Äî all of which are under assault by elements of the Democratic Party.

 The cosmopolitans elite look down on the common affections that once bound this nation together: things like place and national feeling and religious faith. They regard our inherited traditions as oppressive and our shared institutions‚Äîlike family and neighborhood and church‚Äîas backwards.

And all of this‚Äîthe economic globalizing the social liberationism‚Äîhas worked quite well. For some. For the cosmopolitans class.

 As modern life brings changes in our society it also puts stresses on families trying to adjust to new realities while maintaining cherished values. Economic uncertainty unemployment housing difficulties women's and men's concerns with their changing and often conflicting roles high divorce rates threatened neighborhoods and schools and public scandal all create a hostile atmosphere that erodes family structures and traditional family values. Thus it is imperative that our government's programs actions officials and social welfare institutions never be allowed to jeopardize the family. We fear the government may be powerful enough to destroy our families; we know that it is not powerful enough to replace them. 	1

In the UK women are reaching out to each other across party lines concerned about the erosion of their hard-won rights and widespread intimidation. None of the gender critical women I‚Äôve talked to hates trans people; on the contrary. Many of them became interested in this issue in the first place out of concern for trans youth and they‚Äôre hugely sympathetic towards trans adults who simply want to live their lives but who‚Äôre facing a backlash for a brand of activism they don‚Äôt endorse. 	1

 We all know it starts with the family. I can tell you that child in a home without a father has a better chance of going to prison than the kid down the street whose dad's at home attending to his responsibilities as a father. People might not want to talk about that but dads in the home most of the time actually works....I said they even changed the name to what you guys are now? Not dads or fathers anymore. What are they? Baby daddies. What a sad commentary for this nation  	1

 I think raising taxes on small businesses would be a mistake. It would hurt our economy. I'm running against a fellow who's promised $2.2 trillion in new Federal spending so far and we haven't even got to the stretch run yet. So they said How are you going to pay for it? He said Oh that's simple. We'll just tax the rich. You run up the top two brackets of the individual income taxes you're taxing about a million small businesses here in America. Seventy percent of new jobs in America are created by small businesses and you're taxing the job creation. 	1

 I wrote an op-ed in the New York Times. It had a very simple message very simple common sense message grounded in American history and law supported by a majority of Americans arguing very simply if the police cannot or especially if they are not allowed to restore order then it is time to send in the troops. And what happened next? Total meltdown with the little SJWs at the New York Times. All these children that have been marinated in the language of the campus seminar room. They said things like ‚ÄúYour words put my life at risk‚Äù as if typing on their phone sitting on their futons was as dangerous as being a cop trying to stop rioters in the streets. Or ‚ÄúYour words are violence.‚Äù Now I‚Äôm sorry Kiddo. Words are words. Violence is what your friends are doing out on the streets of America. 	1
 This is a vaccine that does not have full scientific testing there are thousands of proven side effects and long-term effects from people who have taken it and we do not know for certain the problems it could possibly cause children down the road. At its core this is an issue of parental choice and in every case I will side with our parents to make decisions for their children that align with their beliefs. I will not stand by and allow any state agency to interfere with our parents‚Äô right to choose what‚Äôs best for their children. 	1
 Just as in a previous generation we had an organized effort against the mob. We need to take these people on. They are often connected to big drug cartels they are not just gangs of kids anymore.

 A fundamental change is needed in how we treat gender dysphoria yes. But another equally important change is the need for more non-ideologically captured non-affirming therapists and doctors to take on the care of those with regret.	1
 Over the past decades we've talked of curtailing government spending so that we can then lower the tax burden. Sometimes we've even taken a run at doing that. But there were always those who told us that taxes couldn't be cut until spending was reduced. Well you know we can lecture our children about extravagance until we run out of voice and breath. Or we can cure their extravagance by simply reducing their allowance...We must increase productivity. That means making it possible for industry to modernize and make use of the technology which we ourselves invented. That means putting Americans back to work. And that means above all bringing government spending back within government revenues which is the only way together with increased productivity that we can reduce and yes eliminate inflation. 	1

 You see the rot at the core of the system‚Äôs embracing of the neofascist wing of the ruling class which is Donald Trump and company.

 Get out and vote. But they even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths where so many cities are corrupt. And you see that. And fraudulent voting is all too common. And then they criticize us for saying that. And we have even Republicans Oh that's such a terrible thing to say.	1
 It helps explain why whichever party you vote for you invariably end up with the same policies. In the UK for example Labour Opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer is a member of the Trilateral Commission one of those shadowy supranational organisations pushing toward the same goals ‚Äî ‚Äòsustainability‚Äô (a cosy codeword for eco-fascism) biosecurity Central Bank Digital Currencies etc ‚Äî currently being chased by Boris Johnson and leaders around the world.

 The conflation of the category of sex with the category of ‚Äògender identity‚Äô hinders the protection of women and girls from violence perpetrated against them by men and boys. It increasingly enables men who consider that they have a female ‚Äògender identity‚Äô to claim access to female single sex victim support services and spaces as both service users and as service providers. This includes specialist single-sex provisions for women and girls who have been subject to violence such as shelters and health care facilities. It also includes other services in which single-sex provision is crucial to the promotion of the physical safety health privacy and dignity of women and girls. The presence of men in female single-sex spaces and services undermines the role of these services in protect women and girls and could make women and girls vulnerable to violent men who may claim a female ‚Äògender identity‚Äô. 	1

 This week we have twice seen Supreme Court Justices violating their judicial oaths. Yesterday the Justices re-wrote Obamacare yet again in order to force this failed law on the American people.

 But when I started this campaign I started it very strongly. It's called Make America Great Again. We're going to make America great. We have a depleted military. It has to be helped has to be fixed. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military. We don't take care of our veterans. We take care of illegal immigrants people that come into the country illegally better than we take care of our vets. That can't happen.	1

 I still believe the answer to any problem lies with the people. I believe in states' rights.

 What we don‚Äôt do is teach our children to view everything through a lens of race where we divide them into buckets ‚Äì one group‚Äôs an oppressor and another group‚Äôs a victim ‚Äì and we pit them against each other and we steal their dreams. We will not be a commonwealth of dream-stealers. We will be a commonwealth of dream-enablers and builders. We know it's not right. We're all created equal and we're trying so hard to live up to those immortal words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who implored us to be better than we are; to judge one another based on the content of our character and not the color of our skin. And so let me be clear on day one we will not have political agendas in the classroom and I will ban critical race theory.  	1

 I remembered Philadelphia in the 1960s then I heard this and something dawned on me.
